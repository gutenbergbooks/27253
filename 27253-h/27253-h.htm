<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>(p. v)</span> PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The present work is the outcome of two lines of study pursued, with more
or less interruption from other studies, for about thirty years. It will
be observed that the book has two themes, as different in character as
the themes for voice and piano in Schubert's "Frühlingsglaube," and yet
so closely related that the one is needful for an adequate comprehension
of the other. In order to view in their true perspective the series of
events comprised in the Discovery of America, one needs to form a mental
picture of that strange world of savagery and barbarism to which
civilized Europeans were for the first time introduced in the course of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in their voyages along the
African coast, into the Indian and Pacific oceans, and across the
Atlantic. Nothing that Europeans discovered during that stirring period
was so remarkable as these antique phases of human society, the mere
existence of which had scarcely been suspected, and the real character
of which it has been left for the present generation to begin to
understand. Nowhere was <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>(p. vi)</span> this ancient society so full of
instructive lessons as in aboriginal America, which had pursued its own
course of development, cut off and isolated from the Old World, for
probably more than fifty thousand years. The imperishable interest of
those episodes in the Discovery of America known as the conquests of
Mexico and Peru consists chiefly in the glimpses they afford us of this
primitive world. It was not an uninhabited continent that the Spaniards
found, and in order to comprehend the course of events it is necessary
to know something about those social features that formed a large part
of the burden of the letters of Columbus and Vespucius, and excited even
more intense and general interest in Europe than the purely geographical
questions suggested by the voyages of those great sailors. The
descriptions of ancient America, therefore, which form a kind of
background to the present work, need no apology.</p>

<p>It was the study of prehistoric Europe and of early Aryan institutions
that led me by a natural sequence to the study of aboriginal America. In
1869, after sketching the plan of a book on our Aryan forefathers, I was
turned aside for five years by writing "Cosmic Philosophy." During that
interval I also wrote "Myths and Myth-Makers" as a side-work to the
projected book on the Aryans, and as soon as the excursion into the
field of general philosophy was ended, in 1874, the work on <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span>
that book was resumed. Fortunately it was not then carried to
completion, for it would have been sadly antiquated by this time. The
revolution in theory concerning the Aryans has been as remarkable as the
revolution in chemical theory which some years ago introduced the New
Chemistry. It is becoming eminently probable that the centre of
diffusion of Aryan speech was much nearer to Lithuania than to any part
of Central Asia, and it has for some time been quite clear that the
state of society revealed in Homer and the Vedas is not at all like
primitive society, but very far from it. By 1876 I had become convinced
that there was no use in going on without widening the field of study.
The conclusions of the Aryan school needed to be supplemented, and often
seriously modified, by the study of the barbaric world, and it soon
became manifest that for the study of barbarism there is no other field
that for fruitfulness can be compared with aboriginal America.</p>

<p>This is because the progress of society was much slower in the western
hemisphere than in the eastern, and in the days of Columbus and Cortes
it had nowhere "caught up" to the points reached by the Egyptians of the
Old Empire or by the builders of Mycenæ and Tiryns. In aboriginal
America we therefore find states of society preserved in stages of
development similar to those of our ancestral societies in the Old World
long ages <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span> before Homer and the Vedas. Many of the social
phenomena of ancient Europe are also found in aboriginal America, but
always in a more primitive condition. The clan, phratry, and tribe among
the Iroquois help us in many respects to get back to the original
conceptions of the gens, curia, and tribe among the Romans. We can
better understand the growth of kingship of the Agamemnon type when we
have studied the less developed type in Montezuma. The house-communities
of the southern Slavs are full of interest for the student of the early
phases of social evolution, but the Mandan round-house and the Zuñi
pueblo carry us much deeper into the past. Aboriginal American
institutions thus afford one of the richest fields in the world for the
application of the comparative method, and the red Indian, viewed in
this light, becomes one of the most interesting of men; for in studying
him intelligently, one gets down into the stone age of human thought. No
time should be lost in gathering whatever can be learned of his ideas
and institutions, before their character has been wholly lost under the
influence of white men. Under that influence many Indians have been
quite transformed, while others have been as yet but little affected.
Some extremely ancient types of society, still preserved on this
continent in something like purity, are among the most instructive
monuments of the past that can now be <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span> found in the world. Such
a type is that of the Moquis of northeastern Arizona. I have heard a
rumour, which it is to be hoped is ill-founded, that there are persons
who wish the United States government to interfere with this peaceful
and self-respecting people, break up their pueblo life, scatter them in
farmsteads, and otherwise compel them, against their own wishes, to
change their habits and customs. If such a cruel and stupid thing were
ever to be done, we might justly be said to have equalled or surpassed
the folly of those Spaniards who used to make bonfires of Mexican
hieroglyphics. It is hoped that the present book, in which of course it
is impossible to do more than sketch the outlines and indicate the
bearings of so vast a subject, will serve to awaken readers to the
interest and importance of American archæology for the general study of
the evolution of human society.</p>

<p>So much for the first and subsidiary theme. As for my principal theme,
the Discovery of America, I was first drawn to it through its close
relations with a subject which for some time chiefly occupied my mind,
the history of the contact between the Aryan and Semitic worlds, and
more particularly between Christians and Mussulmans about the shores of
the Mediterranean. It is also interesting as part of the history of
science, and furthermore as connected with the beginnings of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>(p. x)</span> one
of the most momentous events in the career of mankind, the colonization
of the barbaric world by Europeans. Moreover, the discovery of America
has its full share of the romantic fascination that belongs to most of
the work of the Renaissance period. I have sought to exhibit these
different aspects of the subject.</p>

<p>The present book is in all its parts written from the original sources
of information. The work of modern scholars has of course been freely
used, but never without full acknowledgment in text or notes, and seldom
without independent verification from the original sources.
Acknowledgments are chiefly due to Humboldt, Morgan, Bandelier, Major,
Varnhagen, Markham, Helps, and Harrisse. To the last-named scholar I owe
an especial debt of gratitude, in common with all who have studied this
subject since his arduous researches were begun. Some of the most
valuable parts of his work have consisted in the discovery,
reproduction, and collation of documents; and to some extent his pages
are practically equivalent to the original sources inspected by him in
the course of years of search through European archives, public and
private. In the present book I must have expressed dissent from his
conclusions at least as often as agreement with them, but whether one
agrees with him or not, one always finds him helpful and stimulating.
Though he has in some sort made <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>(p. xi)</span> himself a Frenchman in the
course of his labours, it is pleasant to recall the fact that M.
Harrisse is by birth our fellow-countryman; and there are surely few
Americans of our time whom students of history have more reason for
holding in honour.</p>

<p>I have not seen Mr. Winsor's "Christopher Columbus" in time to make any
use of it. Within the last few days, while my final chapter is going to
press, I have received the sheets of it, a few days in advance of
publication. I do not find in it any references to sources of
information which I have not already fully considered, so that our
differences of opinion on sundry points may serve to show what diverse
conclusions may be drawn from the same data. The most conspicuous
difference is that which concerns the personal character of Columbus.
Mr. Winsor writes in a spirit of energetic (not to say violent) reaction
against the absurdities of Roselly de Lorgues and others who have tried
to make a saint of Columbus; and under the influence of this reaction he
offers us a picture of the great navigator that serves to raise a
pertinent question. No one can deny that Las Casas was a keen judge of
men, or that his standard of right and wrong was quite as lofty as any
one has reached in our own time. He had a much more intimate knowledge
of Columbus than any modern historian can ever hope to acquire, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii"></a>(p. xii)</span> always speaks of him with warm admiration and respect. But how
could Las Casas ever have respected the feeble, mean-spirited driveller
whose portrait Mr. Winsor asks us to accept as that of the Discoverer of
America?</p>

<p>If, however, instead of his biographical estimate of Columbus, we
consider Mr. Winsor's contributions toward a correct statement of the
difficult geographical questions connected with the subject, we
recognize at once the work of an acknowledged master in his chosen
field. It is work, too, of the first order of importance. It would be
hard to mention a subject on which so many reams of direful nonsense
have been written as on the discovery of America; and the prolific
source of so much folly has generally been what Mr. Freeman fitly calls
"bondage to the modern map." In order to understand what the great
mariners of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were trying to do, and
what people supposed them to have done, one must begin by resolutely
banishing the modern map from one's mind. The ancient map must take its
place, but this must not be the ridiculous "Orbis Veteribus Notus," to
be found in the ordinary classical atlas, <i>which simply copies the
outlines of countries with modern accuracy from the modern map, and then
scatters ancient names over them!</i> Such maps are worse than useless. In
dealing with the discovery of America one must steadily keep before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiii" name="pagexiii"></a>(p. xiii)</span> one's mind the quaint notions of ancient geographers,
especially Ptolemy and Mela, as portrayed upon such maps as are
reproduced in the present volume. It was just these distorted and hazy
notions that swayed the minds and guided the movements of the great
discoverers, and went on reproducing themselves upon newly-made maps for
a century or more after the time of Columbus. Without constant reference
to these old maps one cannot begin to understand the circumstances of
the discovery of America.</p>

<p>In no way can one get at the heart of the matter more completely than by
threading the labyrinth of causes and effects through which the western
hemisphere came slowly and gradually to be known by the name <span class="smcap">America</span>.
The reader will not fail to observe the pains which I have taken to
elucidate this subject, not from any peculiar regard for Americus
Vespucius, but because the quintessence of the whole geographical
problem of the discovery of the New World is in one way or another
involved in the discussion. I can think of no finer instance of the
queer complications that can come to surround and mystify an increase of
knowledge too great and rapid to be comprehended by a single generation
of men.</p>

<p>In the solution of the problem as to the first Vespucius voyage I follow
the lead of Varnhagen, but always independently and with the documentary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiv" name="pagexiv"></a>(p. xiv)</span> evidence fully in sight. For some years I vainly tried to
pursue Humboldt's clues to some intelligible conclusion, and felt
inhospitably inclined toward Varnhagen's views as altogether too
plausible; he seemed to settle too many difficulties at once. But after
becoming convinced of the spuriousness of the Bandini letter (see below,
vol. ii. p. 94); and observing how the air at once was cleared in some
directions, it seemed that further work in textual criticism would be
well bestowed. I made a careful study of the diction of the letter from
Vespucius to Soderini in its two principal texts:&mdash;1. the Latin version
of 1507, the original of which is in the library of Harvard University,
appended to Waldseemüller's "Cosmographiæ Introductio"; 2. the Italian
text reproduced severally by Bandini, Canovai, and Varnhagen, from the
excessively rare original, of which only five copies are now known to be
in existence. It is this text that Varnhagen regards as the original
from which the Latin version of 1507 was made, through an intermediate
French version now lost. In this opinion Varnhagen does not stand alone,
as Mr. Winsor seems to think ("Christopher Columbus," p. 540, line 5
from bottom), for Harrisse and Avezac have expressed themselves plainly
to the same effect (see below, vol. ii. p. 42). A minute study of this
text, with all its quaint interpolations of Spanish and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexv" name="pagexv"></a>(p. xv)</span>
Portuguese idioms and seafaring phrases into the Italian ground-work of
its diction, long ago convinced me that it never was a <i>translation</i>
from anything in heaven or earth or the waters under the earth. Nobody
would ever have translated a document <i>into</i> such an extremely peculiar
and individual jargon. It is most assuredly an original text, and its
author was either Vespucius or the Old Nick. It was by starting from
this text as primitive that Varnhagen started correctly in his
interpretation of the statements in the letter, and it was for that
reason that he was able to dispose of so many difficulties at one blow.
When he showed that the landfall of Vespucius on his first voyage was
near Cape Honduras and had nothing whatever to do with the Pearl Coast,
he began to follow the right trail, and so the facts which had puzzled
everybody began at once to fall into the right places. This is all made
clear in the seventh chapter of the present work, where the general
argument of Varnhagen is in many points strongly reinforced. The
evidence here set forth in connection with the Cantino map is especially
significant.</p>

<p>It is interesting on many accounts to see the first voyage of Vespucius
thus elucidated, though it had no connection with the application of his
name by Waldseemüller to an entirely different region from any that was
visited upon that voyage. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvi" name="pagexvi"></a>(p. xvi)</span> The real significance of the third
voyage of Vespucius, in connection with the naming of America, is now
set forth, I believe, for the first time in the light thrown upon the
subject by the opinions of Ptolemy and Mela. Neither Humboldt nor Major
nor Harrisse nor Varnhagen seems to have had a firm grasp of what was in
Waldseemüller's mind when he wrote the passage photographed below in
vol. ii. p. 136 of this work. It is only when we keep the Greek and
Roman theories in the foreground and unflinchingly bar out that
intrusive modern atlas, that we realize what the Freiburg geographer
meant and why Ferdinand Columbus was not in the least shocked or
surprised.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have at various times given lectures on the discovery of America and
questions connected therewith, more especially at University College,
London, in 1879, at the Philosophical Institution in Edinburgh, in 1880,
at the Lowell Institute in Boston, in 1890, and in the course of my work
as professor in the Washington University at St. Louis; but the present
work is in no sense whatever a reproduction of such lectures.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments are due to Mr. Winsor for his cordial permission to make
use of a number of reproductions of old maps and facsimiles already used
by him in the "Narrative and Critical History of America;" they are
mentioned in the lists <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvii" name="pagexvii"></a>(p. xvii)</span> of illustrations. I have also to thank
Dr. Brinton for allowing me to reproduce a page of old Mexican music,
and the Hakluyt Society for permission to use the Zeno and Catalan maps
and the view of Kakortok church. Dr. Fewkes has very kindly favoured me
with a sight of proof-sheets of some recent monographs by Bandelier. And
for courteous assistance at various libraries I have most particularly
to thank Mr. Kiernan of Harvard University, Mr. Appleton Griffin of the
Boston Public Library, and Mr. Uhler of the Peabody Institute in
Baltimore.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is one thing which I feel obliged, though with extreme hesitation
and reluctance, to say to my readers in this place, because the time has
come when something ought to be said, and there seems to be no other
place available for saying it. For many years letters&mdash;often in a high
degree interesting and pleasant to receive&mdash;have been coming to me from
persons with whom I am not acquainted, and I have always done my best to
answer them. It is a long time since such letters came to form the
larger part of a voluminous mass of correspondence. The physical fact
has assumed dimensions with which it is no longer possible to cope. If I
were to answer all the letters which arrive by every mail, I should
never be able to do another day's work. It is becoming impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexviii" name="pagexviii"></a>(p. xviii)</span> even to <i>read</i> them all; and there is scarcely time for
giving due attention to one in ten. Kind friends and readers will thus
understand that if their queries seem to be neglected, it is by no means
from any want of good will, but simply from the lamentable fact that the
day contains only four-and-twenty hours.</p>

<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="page001" name="page001"></a>(p. 001)</span> THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br>

<span class="smaller">ANCIENT AMERICA.</span></h2>

<p>When the civilized people of Europe first became acquainted with the
continents of North and South America, they found them inhabited by a
race of men quite unlike any of the races with which they were familiar
in the Old World. <span class="sidenote">The American aborigines.</span>
Between the various tribes of this aboriginal American
race, except in the sub-arctic region, there is now seen to be a general
physical likeness, such as to constitute an American type of mankind as
clearly recognizable as those types which we call Mongolian and Malay,
though far less pronounced than such types as the Australian or the
negro. The most obvious characteristics possessed in common by the
American aborigines are the copper-coloured or rather the
cinnamon-coloured complexion, along with the high cheek-bones and small
deep-set eyes, the straight black hair and absence or scantiness of
beard. With regard to stature, length of limbs, massiveness of frame,
and shape of skull, considerable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> divergencies may be noticed
among the various American tribes, as indeed is also the case among the
members of the white race in Europe, and of other races. With regard to
culture the differences have been considerable, although, with two or
three apparent but not real exceptions, there was nothing in
pre-Columbian America that could properly be called civilization; the
general condition of the people ranged all the way from savagery to
barbarism of a high type.</p>

<p>Soon after America was proved not to be part of Asia, a puzzling
question arose. Whence came these "Indians," and in what manner did they
find their way to the western hemisphere. Since the beginning of the
present century discoveries in geology have entirely altered our mental
attitude toward this question. It was formerly argued upon the two
assumptions that the geographical relations of land and water had been
always pretty much the same as we now find them, and that all the racial
differences among men have arisen since the date of the "Noachian
Deluge," which was generally placed somewhere between two and three
thousand years before the Christian era. <span class="sidenote">Question as to their origin.</span>
Hence inasmuch as European
tradition knows nothing of any such race as the Indians, it was supposed
that at some time within the historic period they must have moved
eastward from Asia into America; and thus "there was felt to be a sort
of speculative necessity for discovering points of resemblance between
American languages, myths, and social observances and those of the
Oriental world. Now the aborigines <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> of this Continent were made
out to be Kamtchatkans, and now Chinamen, and again they were shown,
with quaint erudition, to be remnants of the ten tribes of Israel.
Perhaps none of these theories have been exactly disproved, but they
have all been superseded and laid on the shelf."<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="small">[1]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> The
tendency of modern discovery is indeed toward agreement with the
time-honoured tradition which makes the Old World, and perhaps Asia, the
earliest dwelling-place of mankind. Competition has been far more active
in the fauna of the eastern hemisphere than in that of the western,
natural selection has accordingly resulted in the evolution of higher
forms, and it is there that we find both extinct and surviving species
of man's nearest collateral relatives, those tailless half-human apes,
the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon.
<span class="sidenote">Antiquity of man in America.</span>
It is altogether probable
that the people whom the Spaniards found in America came by migration
from the Old World. But it is by no means probable that their migration
occurred within so short a period as five or six thousand years.
A series of observations and discoveries kept up for the last half-century
seem to show that North America has been continuously inhabited by human
beings since the earliest Pleistocene times, if not earlier.</p>

<p>The first group of these observations and discoveries relate to
"middens" or shell-heaps. On the banks of the Damariscotta river in
Maine are some of the most remarkable shell-heaps in the world. With an
average thickness of six or seven feet, they rise in places to a height
of twenty-five feet.
<span class="sidenote">Shell-mounds.</span>
They consist almost entirely of huge oyster-shells
often ten inches in length and sometimes much longer. The shells belong
to a salt-water species. In some places "there is an appearance of
stratification covered by an alternation of shells and earth, as if the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> deposition of shells had been from time to time interrupted,
and a vegetable mould had covered the surface." In these heaps have been
found fragments of pottery and of the bones of such edible animals as
the moose and deer. "At the very foundation of one of the highest
heaps," in a situation which must for long ages have been undisturbed,
Mr. Edward Morse "found the remains of an ancient fire-place, where he
exhumed charcoal, bones, and pottery."<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2"><span class="small">[2]</span></a> The significant circumstance
is that "at the present time oysters are only found in very small
numbers, too small to make it an object to gather them," and so far as
memory and tradition can reach, such seems to have been the case. The
great size of the heap, coupled with the notable change in the
distribution of this mollusk since the heap was abandoned, implies a
very considerable lapse of time since the vestiges of human occupation
were first left here. Similar conclusions have been drawn from the banks
or mounds of shells on the St. John's river in Florida,<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3"><span class="small">[3]</span></a> on the
Alabama river, at Grand Lake on the lower Mississippi, and at San Pablo
in the bay of San Francisco. Thus at various points from Maine to
California, and in connection with one particular kind of memorial, we
find records of the presence of man at a period undoubtedly prehistoric,
but not necessarily many thousands of years old.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span>

<p>The second group of discoveries carries us back much farther, even into
the earlier stages of that widespread glaciation which was the most
remarkable feature of the Pleistocene period.
<span class="sidenote">The Glacial Period.</span>
At the periods of greatest
cold "the continent of North America was deeply swathed in ice as far
south as the latitude of Philadelphia, while glaciers descended into
North Carolina."<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4"><span class="small">[4]</span></a> The valleys of the Rocky Mountains also supported
enormous glaciers, and a similar state of things existed at the same
time in Europe. These periods of intense cold were alternated with long
interglacial periods during which the climate was warmer than it is
to-day. Concerning the antiquity of the Pleistocene age, which was
characterized by such extraordinary vicissitudes of heat and cold, there
has been, as in all questions relating to geological time, much conflict
of opinion. Twenty years ago geologists often argued as if there were an
unlimited fund of past time upon which to draw; but since Sir William
Thomson and other physicists emphasized the point that in an antiquity
very far from infinite this earth must have been a molten mass, there
has been a reaction. In many instances further study has shown that less
time was needed in order to effect a given change than had formerly been
supposed; and so there has grown up a tendency to shorten the time
assigned to geological periods. Here, as in so many other cases, the
truth is doubtless to be sought within the extremes. If we adopt the
magnificent argument of Dr. Croll, which seems <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> to me still to
hold its ground against all adverse criticism,<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5"><span class="small">[5]</span></a> and regard the Glacial
epoch as coincident with the last period of high eccentricity of the
earth's orbit, we obtain a result that is moderate and probable. That
astronomical period began about 240,000 years ago and came to an end
about 80,000 years ago. During this period the eccentricity was seldom
less than .04, and at one time rose to .0569. At the present time the
eccentricity is .0168, and nearly 800,000 years will pass before it
attains such a point as it reached during the Glacial epoch. For the
last 50,000 years the departure of the earth's orbit from a circular
form has been exceptionally small.</p>

<p>Now the traces of the existence of men in North America during the
Glacial epoch have in recent years been discovered in abundance, as for
example, the palæolithic quartzite implements found in the drift near
the city of St. Paul, which date from toward the close of the Glacial
epoch<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6"><span class="small">[6]</span></a>; the fragment of a human jaw found in the red clay deposited in
Minnesota during an earlier part of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> that epoch;<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="small">[7]</span></a> the noble
collection of palæoliths found by Dr. C. C. Abbott in the Trenton
gravels in New Jersey; and the more recent discoveries of Dr. Metz and
Mr. H. T. Cresson.</p>

<p>The year 1873 marks an era in American archæology as memorable as the
year 1841 in the investigation of the antiquity of man in Europe. With
reference to these problems Dr. Abbott occupies a position similar to
that of Boucher de Perthes in the Old World, and the Trenton valley is
coming to be classic ground, like the valley of the Somme. In April,
1873, Dr. Abbott published his description of three rude implements
which he had found some sixteen feet below the surface of the ground "in
the gravels of a bluff overlooking the Delaware river."
<span class="sidenote">Discoveries in the Trenton gravel.</span>
The implements
were in place in an undisturbed deposit, and could not have found their
way thither in any recent time; Dr. Abbott assigned them to the age of
the Glacial drift. This was the beginning of a long series of
investigations, in which Dr. Abbott's work was assisted and supplemented
by Messrs. Whitney, Carr, Putnam, Shaler, Lewis, Wright, Haynes,
Dawkins, and other eminent geologists and archæologists. By 1888 Dr.
Abbott had obtained not less than 60 implements from various recorded
depths in the gravel, while many others were found at depths not
recorded or in the talus of the banks.<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8"><span class="small">[8]</span></a> Three human skulls and other
bones, along with the tusk <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> of a mastodon, have been discovered
in the same gravel. Careful studies have been made of the conditions
under which the gravel-banks were deposited and their probable age; and
it is generally agreed that they date from the later portion of the
Glacial period, or about the time of the final recession of the
ice-sheet from this region. At that time, in its climate and general
aspect, New York harbour must have been much like a Greenland fiord of
the present day. In 1883 Professor Wright of Oberlin, after a careful
study of the Trenton deposits and their relations to the terrace and
gravel deposits to the westward, predicted that similar palæolithic
implements would be found in Ohio. Two years afterward, the prediction
was verified by Dr. Metz, who found a true palæolith of black flint at
Madisonville, in the Little Miami valley, eight feet below the surface.
<span class="sidenote">Discoveries in Ohio, Indiana, and Minnesota;</span>
Since then further discoveries have been made in the same neighbourhood
by Dr. Metz, and in Jackson county, Indiana, by Mr. H. T. Cresson; and
the existence of man in that part of America toward the close of the
Glacial period may be regarded as definitely established. The
discoveries of Miss Babbitt and Professor Winchell, in Minnesota, carry
the conclusion still farther, and add to the probability of the
existence of a human population all the way from the Atlantic coast to
the upper Mississippi valley at that remote antiquity.</p>

<p>A still more remarkable discovery was made by Mr. Cresson in July, 1887,
at Claymont, in the north of Delaware. In a deep cut of the Baltimore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> and Ohio Railroad, in a stratum of Philadelphia red gravel and
brick clay, <span class="sidenote">and in Delaware.</span>
Mr. Cresson obtained an unquestionable palæolith, and a few
months afterward his diligent search was rewarded with another.<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9" title="Go to footnote 9"><span class="small">[9]</span></a> This
formation dates from far back in the Glacial period. If we accept Dr.
Croll's method of reckoning, we can hardly assign to it an antiquity
less than 150,000 years.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span>

<p>But according to Professor Josiah Whitney there is reason for supposing
that man existed in California at a still more remote period.
<span class="sidenote">The Calaveras skull.</span>
He holds
that the famous skull discovered in 1866, in the gold-bearing gravels of
Calaveras county, belongs to the Pliocene age.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10"><span class="small">[10]</span></a> If this be so, it
seems to suggest an antiquity not less than twice as great as that just
mentioned. The question as to the antiquity of the Calaveras skull is
still hotly disputed among the foremost palæontologists, but as one
reads the arguments one cannot help feeling that theoretical
difficulties have put the objectors into a somewhat inhospitable
attitude toward the evidence so ably presented by Professor Whitney. It
has been too hastily assumed that, from the point of view of evolution,
the existence of Pliocene man is improbable. Upon general
considerations, however, we have strong reason for believing that human
beings must have inhabited some portions of the earth throughout the
whole duration of the Pliocene period, and it need not surprise us if
their remains are presently discovered in more places than one.<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11"><span class="small">[11]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span>

<p>Whatever may be the final outcome of the Calaveras controversy, there
can be no doubt as to the existence of man in North America far back in
early Pleistocene times. The men of the River-drift, who long dwelt in
western Europe during <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> the milder intervals of the Glacial
period, but seem to have become extinct toward the end of it, are well
known to palæontologists through their bones and their rude tools.
Contemporaneously with these Europeans of the River-drift there
certainly lived some kind of men, of a similar low grade of culture, in
the Mississippi valley and on both the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of
North America.
<span class="sidenote">Pleistocene men and mammals.</span>
Along with these ancient Americans lived some terrestrial
mammals that still survive, such as the elk, reindeer, prairie wolf,
bison, musk-ox, and beaver; and many that have long been extinct, such
as the mylodon, megatherium, megalonyx, mastodon, Siberian elephant,
mammoth, at least six or seven species of ancestral horse, a huge bear
similar to the cave bear of ancient Europe, a lion similar to the
European cave lion, and a tiger as large as the modern tiger of Bengal.</p>

<p>Now while the general relative positions of those stupendous abysses
that hold the oceans do not appear to have undergone any considerable
change since an extremely remote geological period, their shallow
marginal portions have been repeatedly raised so as to add extensive
territories to the edges of continents, and in some cases to convert
archipelagoes into continents, and to join continents previously
separated. Such elevation is followed in turn by an era of subsidence,
and almost everywhere either the one process or the other is slowly
going on. If you look at a model in relief of the continents and
ocean-floors, such as may be seen at the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy
in Cambridge, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> showing the results of a vast number of
soundings in all parts of the world, you cannot fail to be struck with
the shallowness of Bering Sea; <span class="sidenote">Elevation and subsidence.</span>
it looks like a part of the continent
rather than of the ocean, and indeed it is just that,&mdash;an area of
submerged continent. So in the northern Atlantic there is a lofty ridge
running from France to Greenland. The British islands, the Orkney,
Shetland, and Færoe groups, and Iceland are the parts of this ridge high
enough to remain out of water. The remainder of it is shallow sea. Again
and again it has been raised, together with the floor of the German
ocean, so as to become dry land. Both before and since the time when
those stone tools were dropped into the red gravel from which Mr.
Cresson took them the other day, the northwestern part of Europe has
been solid continent for more than a hundred miles to the west of the
French and Irish coasts, the Thames and Humber have been tributaries to
the Rhine, which emptied into the Arctic ocean, and across the Atlantic
ridge one might have walked to the New World dry-shod.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12"><span class="small">[12]</span></a> In similar
wise the northwestern corner of America has repeatedly been joined to
Siberia through the elevation of Bering Sea.</p>

<p>There have therefore been abundant opportunities for men to get into
America from the Old World without crossing salt water. Probably this
was the case with the ancient inhabitants of the Delaware and Little
Miami valleys; it is not at all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span> likely that men who used their
kind of tools knew much about going on the sea in boats.</p>

<p>Whether the Indians are descended from this ancient population or not,
is a question with which we have as yet no satisfactory method of
dealing. It is not unlikely that these glacial men may have perished
from off the face of the earth, having been crushed and supplanted by
stronger races. <span class="sidenote">Waves of migration.</span>
There may have been several successive waves of
migration, of which the Indians were the latest.<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13"><span class="small">[13]</span></a> There is time
enough for a great many things to happen in a thousand centuries. It
will doubtless be long before all the evidence can be brought in and
ransacked, but of one thing we may feel pretty sure; the past is more
full of changes than we are apt to realize. Our first theories are
usually too simple, and have to be enlarged and twisted into all manner
of shapes in order to cover the actual complication of facts.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14" title="Go to footnote 14"><span class="small">[14]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span>

<p>In this connection the history of the Eskimos introduces us to some
interesting problems. Mention has been made of the River-drift men who
lived in Europe during the milder intervals of the Glacial period. At
such times they made their way into Germany and Britain, along with
leopards, hyænas, and African elephants. But as the cold intervals came
on and the edge of the polar ice-sheet crept southward and mountain
glaciers filled up the valleys, these men and beasts retreated into
Africa; <span class="sidenote">The Cave men of Europe in the Glacial Period.</span>
and their place was taken by a sub-arctic race of men known as
the Cave men, along with the reindeer and arctic fox and musk-sheep.
More than once with the secular alternations of temperature did the
River-drift men thus advance and retreat and advance again, and as they
advanced the Cave men retreated, both races yielding to an enemy
stronger than either,&mdash;to wit, the hostile climate. At length all traces
of the River-drift men vanish, but what of the Cave men? They have left
no representatives among the present populations of Europe, but the
musk-sheep, which always went and came with the Cave men, is to-day
found only in sub-arctic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> America among the Eskimos, and the
fossilized bones of the musk-sheep lie in a regular trail across the
eastern hemisphere, from the Pyrenees through Germany and Russia and all
the vast length of Siberia. The stone arrow-heads, the sewing-needles,
the necklaces and amulets of cut teeth, and the daggers made from
antler, used by the Eskimos, resemble so minutely the implements of the
Cave men, that if recent Eskimo remains were to be put into the
Pleistocene caves of France and England they would be indistinguishable
in appearance from the remains of the Cave men which are now found
there.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15"><span class="small">[15]</span></a> There is another striking point of resemblance. The Eskimos
have a talent for artistic sketching of men and beasts, and scenes in
which men and beasts figure, which is absolutely unrivalled among rude
peoples. One need but look at the sketches by common Eskimo fishermen
which illustrate Dr. Henry Rink's fascinating book on Danish Greenland,
to realize that this rude Eskimo art has a character as pronounced and
unmistakable in its way as the much higher art of the Japanese.
<span class="sidenote">The Eskimos are probably a remnant of the Cave men.</span>
Now
among the European remains of the Cave men are many sketches of
mammoths, cave bears, and other animals now extinct, and hunting scenes
so artfully and vividly portrayed as to bring distinctly before us many
details of daily life in an antiquity so vast that in comparison with it
the interval between the pyramids of Egypt and the Eiffel tower shrinks
into a point. Such a talent is unique among savage peoples. It exists
only among the living Eskimos and the ancient Cave men; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span>
when considered in connection with so many other points of agreement,
and with the indisputable fact that the Cave men were a sub-arctic race,
it affords a strong presumption in favour of the opinion of that great
palæontologist, Professor Boyd Dawkins, that the Eskimos of North
America are to-day the sole survivors of the race that made their homes
in the Pleistocene caves of western Europe.<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16" title="Go to footnote 16"><span class="small">[16]</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> If we have always been accustomed to think of races of men only
as they are placed on modern maps, it at first seems strange to think of
England and France as ever having been inhabited by Eskimos. Facts
equally strange may be cited in abundance from zoölogy and botany. The
camel is found to-day only in Arabia and Bactria; yet in all probability
the camel originated in America,<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17"><span class="small">[17]</span></a> and is an intruder into what we are
accustomed to call his native deserts, just as the people of the United
States are European intruders upon the soil of America. So the giant
trees of Mariposa grove are now found only in California, but there was
once a time when they were as common in Europe<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18" title="Go to footnote 18"><span class="small">[18]</span></a> as maple-trees to-day
in a New England village.</p>

<p>Familiarity with innumerable facts of this sort, concerning the
complicated migrations and distribution of plants and animals, has
entirely altered our way of looking at the question as to the origin of
the American Indians. As already observed, we can hardly be said to
possess sufficient data for determining whether they are descended from
the Pleistocene inhabitants of America, or have come in some later wave
of migration from the Old World. Nor can we as yet determine whether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span> they were earlier or later comers than the Eskimos. But since
we have got rid of that feeling of speculative necessity above referred
to, for bringing the red men from Asia within the historic period, it
has become more and more clear that they have dwelt upon American soil
for a very long time. The aboriginal American, as we know him, with his
language and legends, his physical and mental peculiarities, his social
observances and customs, is most emphatically a native and not an
imported article. He belongs to the American continent as strictly as
its opossums and armadillos, its maize and its golden-rod, or any
members of its aboriginal fauna and flora belong to it.
<span class="sidenote">There was probably no connection or intercourse by water
between ancient America and the Old World.</span>
In all
probability he came from the Old World at some ancient period, whether
pre-glacial or post-glacial, when it was possible to come by land; and
here in all probability, until the arrival of white men from Europe, he
remained undisturbed by later comers, unless the Eskimos may have been
such. There is not a particle of evidence to suggest any connection or
intercourse between aboriginal America and Asia within any such period
as the last twenty thousand years, except in so far as there may perhaps
now and then have been slight surges of Eskimo tribes back and forth
across Bering strait.</p>

<p>The Indians must surely be regarded as an entirely different stock from
the Eskimos. On the other hand, the most competent American ethnologists
are now pretty thoroughly agreed that all the aborigines south of the
Eskimo region, all the way from Hudson's Bay to Cape Horn, belong
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span> to one and the same race. It was formerly supposed that the
higher culture of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Peruvians must indicate that
they were of different race from the more barbarous Algonquins and
Dakotas; <span class="sidenote">There is one great American "red" race.</span>
and a speculative necessity was felt for proving that, whatever
may have been the case with the other American peoples, this higher
culture at any rate must have been introduced within the historic period
from the Old World.<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19" title="Go to footnote 19"><span class="small">[19]</span></a> This feeling was caused partly by the fact that,
owing to crude and loosely-framed conceptions of the real points of
difference between civilization and barbarism, this Central American
culture was absurdly exaggerated. As the further study of the
uncivilized parts of the world has led to more accurate and precise
conceptions, this kind of speculative necessity has ceased to be felt.
There is an increasing disposition among scholars to agree that the
warrior of Anahuac and the shepherd of the Andes were just simply
Indians, and that their culture was no less indigenous than that of the
Cherokees or Mohawks.</p>

<p>To prevent any possible misconception of my meaning, a further word of
explanation may be needed at this point.
<span class="sidenote">Different senses in which the word "race" is used.</span>
The word "race" is used in such
widely different senses that there is apt to be more or less vagueness
about it. The difference is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> mainly in what logicians call
extension; sometimes the word covers very little ground, sometimes a
great deal. We say that the people of England, of the United States, and
of New South Wales belong to one and the same race; and we say that an
Englishman, a Frenchman, and a Greek belong to three different races.
There is a sense in which both these statements are true. But there is
also a sense in which we may say that the Englishman, the Frenchman, and
the Greek belong to one and the same race; and that is when we are
contrasting them as white men with black men or yellow men. Now we may
correctly say that a Shawnee, an Ojibwa, and a Kickapoo belong to one
and the same Algonquin race; that a Mohawk and a Tuscarora belong to one
and the same Iroquois race; but that an Algonquin differs from an
Iroquois somewhat as an Englishman differs from a Frenchman. No doubt we
may fairly say that the Mexicans encountered by Cortes differed in race
from the Iroquois encountered by Champlain, as much as an Englishman
differs from an Albanian or a Montenegrin. But when we are contrasting
aboriginal Americans with white men or yellow men, it is right to say
that Mexicans and Iroquois belong to the same great red race.</p>

<p>In some parts of the world two strongly contrasted races have become
mingled together, or have existed side by side for centuries without
intermingling. In Europe the big blonde Aryan-speaking race has mixed
with the small brunette Iberian race, producing the endless varieties in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span> stature and complexion which may be seen in any drawing-room
in London or New York. In Africa south of Sahara, on the other hand, we
find, interspersed among negro tribes but kept perfectly distinct, that
primitive dwarfish race with yellow skin and tufted hair to which belong
the Hottentots and Bushmen, the Wambatti lately discovered by Mr.
Stanley, and other tribes.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20"><span class="small">[20]</span></a> Now in America south of Hudson's Bay the
case seems to have been quite otherwise, and more as it would have been
in Europe if there had been only Aryans, or in Africa if there had been
only blacks.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21"><span class="small">[21]</span></a></p>

<p>The belief that the people of the Cordilleras must be of radically
different race from other Indians was based upon the vague notion that
grades of culture have some necessary connection with likenesses and
differences of race.
<span class="sidenote">No necessary connection between differences in culture and
differences in race.</span>
There is no such necessary connection.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22"><span class="small">[22]</span></a> Between
the highly civilized Japanese and their barbarous Mandshu cousins the
difference in culture is much greater <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span> than the difference
between Mohawks and Mexicans; and the same may be said of the people of
Israel and Judah in contrast with the Arabs of the desert, or of the
imperial Romans in comparison with their Teutonic kinsmen as described
by Tacitus.</p>

<hr>

<p>At this point, in order to prepare ourselves the more clearly to
understand sundry facts with which we shall hereafter be obliged to
deal, especially the wonderful experiences of the Spanish conquerors,
<span class="sidenote">Grades of culture.</span>
it
will be well to pause for a moment and do something toward defining the
different grades of culture through which men have passed in attaining
to the grade which can properly be called civilization. Unless we begin
with clear ideas upon this head we cannot go far toward understanding
the ancient America that was first visited and described for us by
Spaniards. The various grades of culture need to be classified, and that
most original and suggestive scholar, the late Lewis Morgan of
Rochester, made a brilliant attempt in this direction, to which the
reader's attention is now invited.</p>

<p>Below <i>Civilization</i> Mr. Morgan<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23" title="Go to footnote 23"><span class="small">[23]</span></a> distinguishes two principal grades
or stages of culture, namely <i>Savagery</i> and <i>Barbarism</i>. There is much
looseness and confusion in the popular use of these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> terms, and
this is liable to become a fruitful source of misapprehension in the
case of any statement involving either of them.
<span class="sidenote">Distinction between Savagery and Barbarism.</span>
When popular usage
discriminates between them it discriminates in the right direction;
there is a vague but not uncertain feeling that savagery is a lower
stage than barbarism. But ordinarily the discrimination is not made and
the two terms are carelessly employed as if interchangeable. Scientific
writers long since recognized a general difference between savagery and
barbarism, but Mr. Morgan was the first to suggest a really useful
criterion for distinguishing between them. His criterion is the making
of pottery; and his reason for selecting it is that the making of
pottery is something that presupposes village life and more or less
progress in the simpler arts. The earlier methods of boiling food were
either putting it into holes in the ground lined with skins and then
using heated stones, or else putting it into baskets coated with clay to
be supported over a fire. <span class="sidenote">Origin of pottery.</span>
The clay served the double purpose of
preventing liquids from escaping and protecting the basket against the
flame. It was probably observed that the clay was hardened by the fire,
and thus in course of time it was found that the clay would answer the
purpose without the basket.<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24" title="Go to footnote 24"><span class="small">[24]</span></a> Whoever first made this ingenious
discovery led the way from savagery to barbarism. Throughout the present
work <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> we shall apply the name "savages" only to uncivilized
people who do not make pottery.</p>

<p>But within each of these two stages Mr. Morgan distinguishes three
subordinate stages, or Ethnic Periods, which may be called either lower,
middle, and upper status, or older, middle, and later periods.
<span class="sidenote">Lower status of savagery.</span>
The lower
status of savagery was that wholly prehistoric stage when men lived in
their original restricted habitat and subsisted on fruit and nuts. To
this period must be assigned the beginning of articulate speech. All
existing races of men had passed beyond it at an unknown antiquity.</p>

<p>Men began to pass beyond it when they discovered how to catch fish and
how to use fire. They could then begin
<span class="sidenote">Middle status of savagery.</span>
(following coasts and rivers) to
spread over the earth. The middle status of savagery, thus introduced,
ends with the invention of that compound weapon, the bow and arrow. The
natives of Australia, who do not know this weapon, are still in the
middle status of savagery.<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25" title="Go to footnote 25"><span class="small">[25]</span></a></p>

<p>The invention of the bow and arrow, which marks the upper status of
savagery, was not only a great advance in military art,
<span class="sidenote">Upper status of savagery.</span>
but it also
vastly increased men's supply of food by increasing their power of
killing wild game. The lowest tribes in America, such as those upon the
Columbia river, the Athabaskans of Hudson's Bay, the Fuegians and some
other South American tribes, are in the upper status of savagery.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span>

<p>The transition from this status to the lower status of barbarism was
marked, as before observed, by the invention of pottery. The end of the
lower status of barbarism was marked in the Old World by the
domestication of animals other than the dog, which was probably
domesticated at a much earlier period as an aid to the hunter.
<span class="sidenote">Lower status of barbarism: it ended differently in
the two hemispheres.</span>The
domestication of horses and asses, oxen and sheep, goats and pigs, marks
of course an immense advance. Along with it goes considerable
development of agriculture, thus enabling a small territory to support
many people. It takes a wide range of country to support hunters. In the
New World, except in Peru, the only domesticated animal was the dog.
Horses, oxen, and the other animals mentioned did not exist in America,
during the historic period, until they were brought over from Europe by
the Spaniards. In ancient American society there was no such thing as a
pastoral stage of development,<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26" title="Go to footnote 26"><span class="small">[26]</span></a> and the absence of domesticable
animals from the western hemisphere may well be reckoned as very
important among the causes which retarded the progress of mankind in
this part of the world.</p>

<p>On the other hand the ancient Americans had a cereal plant peculiar to
the New World, which made comparatively small demands upon the
intelligence and industry of the cultivator. Maize or "Indian corn" has
played a most important <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span> part in the history of the New World,
as regards both the red men and the white men. It could be planted
without clearing or ploughing the soil. It was only necessary to girdle
the trees with a stone hatchet, so as to destroy their leaves and let in
the sunshine. A few scratches and digs were made in the ground with a
stone digger, and the seed once dropped in took care of itself.
<span class="sidenote">Importance of Indian corn.</span>
The ears
could hang for weeks after ripening, and could be picked off without
meddling with the stalk; there was no need of threshing and winnowing.
None of the Old World cereals can be cultivated without much more
industry and intelligence. At the same time, when Indian corn is sown in
tilled land it yields with little labour more than twice as much food
per acre as any other kind of grain. This was of incalculable advantage
to the English settlers of New England, who would have found it much
harder to gain a secure foothold upon the soil if they had had to begin
by preparing it for wheat and rye without the aid of the beautiful and
beneficent American plant.<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27" title="Go to footnote 27"><span class="small">[27]</span></a> The Indians of the Atlantic coast of
North America for the most part lived in stockaded villages, and
cultivated their corn along with beans, pumpkins, squashes, and tobacco;
but their cultivation was of the rudest sort,<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28" title="Go to footnote 28"><span class="small">[28]</span></a> and population was too
sparse for much progress toward civilization. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span> But Indian corn,
when sown in carefully tilled and irrigated land, had much to do with
the denser population, the increasing organization of labour, and the
higher development in the arts, which characterized the confederacies of
Mexico and Central America and all the pueblo Indians of the southwest.
The potato played a somewhat similar part in Peru. Hence it seems proper
to take the regular employment of tillage with irrigation as marking the
end of the lower period of barbarism in the New World. To this Mr.
Morgan adds the use of adobe-brick and stone in architecture, which also
distinguished the Mexicans and their neighbours from the ruder tribes of
North and South America. All these ruder tribes, except the few already
mentioned as in the upper period of savagery, were somewhere within the
lower period of barbarism. Thus the Algonquins and Iroquois, the Creeks,
the Dakotas, etc., when first seen by white men, were within this
period; but some had made much further progress within it than others.
For example, the Algonquin tribe of Ojibwas had little more than emerged
from savagery, while the Creeks and Cherokees had made considerable
advance toward the middle status of barbarism.</p>

<p>Let us now observe some characteristics of this extremely interesting
middle period. <span class="sidenote">Middle status of barbarism.</span>
It began, we see, in the eastern hemisphere with the
domestication of other animals than the dog, and in the western
hemisphere with cultivation by irrigation and the use of adobe-brick and
stone for building. It also possessed another <span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> feature which
distinguished it from earlier periods, in the materials of which its
tools were made. In the periods of savagery hatchets and spear-heads
were made of rudely chipped stones. In the lower period of barbarism the
chipping became more and more skilful until it gave place to polishing.
In the middle period tools were greatly multiplied, improved polishing
gave sharp and accurate points and edges, and at last metals began to be
used as materials preferable to stone. In America the metal used was
copper, and in some spots where it was very accessible there were
instances of its use by tribes not in other respects above the lower
status of barbarism,&mdash;as for example, the "mound-builders." In the Old
World the metal used was the alloy of copper and tin familiarly known as
bronze, and in its working it called for a higher degree of intelligence
than copper.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the middle period of barbarism the working of metals
became the most important element of progress,
<span class="sidenote">Working of metals.</span>
and the period may be
regarded as ending with the invention of the process of smelting iron
ore. According to this principle of division, the inhabitants of the
lake villages of ancient Switzerland, who kept horses and oxen, pigs and
sheep, raised wheat and ground it into flour, and spun and wove linen
garments, but knew nothing of iron, were in the middle status of
barbarism. The same was true of the ancient Britons before they learned
the use of iron from their neighbours in Gaul. In the New World the
representatives of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> the middle status of barbarism were such
peoples as the Zuñis, the Aztecs, the Mayas, and the Peruvians.</p>

<p>The upper status of barbarism, in so far as it implies a knowledge of
smelting iron, was never reached in aboriginal America.
<span class="sidenote">Upper status of barbarism.</span>
In the Old World
it is the stage which had been reached by the Greeks of the Homeric
poems<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29" title="Go to footnote 29"><span class="small">[29]</span></a> and the Germans in the time of Cæsar. The end <span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span> of
this period and the beginning of true civilization is marked by the
invention of a phonetic alphabet and the production of written records.
<span class="sidenote">Beginning of civilization.</span>
This brings within the pale of civilization such people as the ancient
Ph&oelig;nicians, the Hebrews after the exodus, the ruling classes at
Nineveh and Babylon, the Aryans of Persia and India, and the Japanese.
But clearly it will not do to insist too narrowly upon the phonetic
character of the alphabet. Where people acquainted with iron have
enshrined in hieroglyphics so much matter of historic record and
literary interest as the Chinese and the ancient Egyptians, they too
must be classed as civilized; and this Mr. Morgan by implication admits.</p>

<p>This brilliant classification of the stages of early culture will be
found very helpful if we only keep in mind the fact that in all wide
generalizations of this sort the case is liable to be somewhat unduly
simplified. The story of human progress is really not quite so easy to
decipher as such descriptions would make it appear, and when we have
laid down rules of this sort we need not be surprised if we now and then
come upon facts that will not exactly fit into them. In such an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span> event it is best not to try to squeeze or distort the unruly
facts, but to look and see if our rules will not bear some little
qualification. The faculty for generalizing is a good servant but a bad
master. If we observe this caution we shall find Mr. Morgan's work to be
of great value. It will be observed that, with one exception, his
restrictions leave the area of civilization as wide as that which we are
accustomed to assign to it in our ordinary speaking and thinking. That
exception is the case of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. We have so
long been accustomed to gorgeous accounts of the civilization of these
countries at the time of their discovery by the Spaniards that it may at
first shock our preconceived notions to see them set down as in the
"middle status of barbarism," one stage higher than Mohawks, and one
stage lower than the warriors of the Iliad.
<span class="sidenote">"Civilizations" of Mexico and Peru.</span>
This does indeed mark a
change since Dr. Draper expressed the opinion that the Mexicans and
Peruvians were morally and intellectually superior to the Europeans of
the sixteenth century.<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30" title="Go to footnote 30"><span class="small">[30]</span></a> The reaction from the state of opinion in
which such an extravagant remark was even possible has been attended
with some controversy; but on the whole Mr. Morgan's main position has
been steadily and rapidly gaining ground, and it is becoming more and
more clear that if we are to use language correctly when we speak of the
civilizations of Mexico and Peru we really mean civilizations of an
extremely archaic type, considerably <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> more archaic than that of
Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs. A "civilization" like that of the
Aztecs, without domestic animals or iron tools, with trade still in the
primitive stage of barter, with human sacrifices, and with cannibalism,
has certainly some of the most vivid features of barbarism. Along with
these primitive features, however, there seem to have been&mdash;after making
all due allowances&mdash;some features of luxury and splendour such as we are
wont to associate with civilization. The Aztecs, moreover, though
doubtless a full ethnical period behind the ancient Egyptians in general
advancement, had worked out a system of hieroglyphic writing, and had
begun to put it to some literary use. It would seem that a people may in
certain special points reach a level of attainment higher than the level
which they occupy in other points. The Cave men of the Glacial period
were ignorant of pottery, and thus had not risen above the upper status
of savagery; but their artistic talent, upon which we have remarked, was
not such as we are wont to associate with savagery. Other instances will
occur to us in the proper place.</p>

<p>The difficulty which people usually find in realizing the true position
of the ancient Mexican culture arises partly from the misconceptions
which have until recently distorted the facts, and partly from the loose
employment of terms above noticed.
<span class="sidenote">Loose use of the words "savagery" and "civilization".</span>
It is quite correct to speak of the
Australian blackfellows as "savages," but nothing is more common than to
hear the same epithet employed to characterize Shawnees <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> and
Mohawks; and to call those Indians "savages" is quite misleading. So on
the other hand the term "civilization" is often so loosely used as to
cover a large territory belonging to "barbarism." One does not look for
scientific precision in newspapers, but they are apt to reflect popular
habits of thought quite faithfully, and for that reason it is proper
here to quote from one. In a newspaper account of Mr. Cushing's recent
discoveries of buried towns, works of irrigation, etc., in Arizona, we
are first told that these are the remains of a "splendid prehistoric
civilization," and the next moment we are told, in entire
unconsciousness of the contradiction, that the people who constructed
these works had only stone tools. Now to call a people "civilized" who
have only stone tools is utterly misleading. Nothing but confusion of
ideas and darkening of counsel can come from such a misuse of words.
Such a people may be in a high degree interesting and entitled to credit
for what they have achieved, but the grade of culture which they have
reached is not "civilization."</p>

<p>With "savagery" thus encroaching upon its area of meaning on the one
side, and "civilization" encroaching on the other, the word "barbarism,"
as popularly apprehended, is left in a vague and unsatisfactory plight.
If we speak of Montezuma's people as barbarians one stage further
advanced than Mohawks, we are liable to be charged with calling them
"savages." <span class="sidenote">Value and importance of the term "barbarism."</span>
Yet the term "barbarism" is a very useful one; indispensable,
indeed, in the history of human progress. There is no other word which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> can serve in its stead as a designation of the enormous
interval which begins with the invention of pottery and ends with the
invention of the alphabet. The popular usage of the word is likely to
become more definite as it comes to be more generally realized how
prodigious that interval has been. When we think what a considerable
portion of man's past existence has been comprised within it, and what a
marvellous transformation in human knowledge and human faculty has been
gradually wrought between its beginning and its end, the period of
barbarism becomes invested with most thrilling interest, and its name
ceases to appear otherwise than respectable. It is Mr. Morgan's chief
title to fame that he has so thoroughly explored this period and
described its features with such masterly skill.</p>

<p>It is worth while to observe that Mr. Morgan's view of the successive
stages of culture is one which could not well have been marked out in
all its parts except by a student of American archæology. Aboriginal
America is the richest field in the world for the study of barbarism.
<span class="sidenote">The status of barbarism is most completely exemplified in
ancient America.</span>
Its people present every gradation in social life during three ethnical
periods&mdash;the upper period of savagery and the lower and middle periods
of barbarism&mdash;so that the process of development may be most
systematically and instructively studied. Until we have become familiar
with ancient American society, and so long as our view is confined to
the phases of progress in the Old World, the demarcation between
civilized and uncivilized life <span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> seems too abrupt and sudden; we
do not get a correct measure of it. The oldest European tradition
reaches back only through the upper period of barbarism.<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31" title="Go to footnote 31"><span class="small">[31]</span></a> The middle
and lower periods have lapsed into utter oblivion, and it is only modern
archæological research that is beginning to recover the traces of them.
But among the red men of America the social life of ages more remote
than that of the lake villages of Switzerland is in many particulars
preserved for us to-day, and when we study it we begin to realize as
never before the continuity of human development, its enormous duration,
and the almost infinite accumulation of slow efforts by which progress
has been achieved. Ancient America is further instructive in presenting
the middle status of barbarism in a different form from that which it
assumed in the eastern hemisphere. Its most conspicuous outward
manifestations, instead of tents and herds, were strange and imposing
edifices of stone, so that it was quite natural that observers
interpreting it from a basis of European experience should mistake it
for civilization. <span class="sidenote">Survivals of bygone epochs of culture.</span>
Certain aspects of that middle period may be studied
to-day in New Mexico and Arizona, as phases of the older periods may
still be found among the wilder tribes, even after all the contact they
have had with white men. These survivals from antiquity will not
permanently outlive that contact, and it is important that no time
should be lost in gathering and putting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span> on record all that can
be learned of the speech and arts, the customs and beliefs, everything
that goes to constitute the philology and anthropology of the red men.
For the intelligent and vigorous work of this sort now conducted by the
Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, under the direction
of Major Powell, no praise can be too strong and no encouragement too
hearty.</p>

<hr>

<p>A brief enumeration of the principal groups of Indians will be helpful
in enabling us to comprehend the social condition of ancient America.
The groups are in great part defined by differences of language, which
are perhaps a better criterion of racial affinity in the New World than
in the Old, because there seems to have been little or nothing of that
peculiar kind of conquest with incorporation resulting in complete
change of speech which we sometimes find in the Old World; as, for
example, when we see the Celto-Iberian population of Spain and the
Belgic, Celtic, and Aquitanian populations of Gaul forgetting their
native tongues, and adopting that of a confederacy of tribes in Latium.
<span class="sidenote">Tribal society and multiplicity of languages in aboriginal
America.</span>
Except in the case of Peru there is no indication that anything of this
sort went on, or that there was anything even superficially analogous to
"empire," in ancient America. What strikes one most forcibly at first is
the vast number of American languages. Adelung, in his "Mithridates,"
put the number at 1,264, and Ludewig, in his "Literature of the American
Languages," put it roundly at 1,100. Squier, on the other hand, was
content <span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> with 400.<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32" title="Go to footnote 32"><span class="small">[32]</span></a> The discrepancy arises from the fact
that where one scholar sees two or three distinct languages another sees
two or three dialects of one language and counts them as one; it is like
the difficulty which naturalists find in agreeing as to what are species
and what are only varieties. The great number of languages and dialects
spoken by a sparse population is one mark of the universal prevalence of
a rude and primitive form of tribal society.<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33" title="Go to footnote 33"><span class="small">[33]</span></a></p>

<p>The lowest tribes in North America were those that are still to be found
in California, in the valley of the Columbia river, and on the shores of
Puget Sound. The Athabaskans of Hudson's Bay were on about the same
level of savagery. <span class="sidenote">Tribes in the upper status of savagery.</span>
They made no pottery, knew nothing of horticulture,
depended for subsistence entirely upon bread-roots, fish, and game, and
thus had no village life. They were mere prowlers in the upper status of
savagery.<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34" title="Go to footnote 34"><span class="small">[34]</span></a> The Apaches of Arizona, preëminent even among red men for
atrocious cruelty, are an offshoot from the Athabaskan stock. Very
little better are the Shoshones and Bannocks that still wander <span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span>
among the lonely bare mountains and over the weird sage-brush plains of
Idaho. The region west of the Rocky Mountains and north of New Mexico is
thus the region of savagery.</p>

<p>Between the Rocky Mountains and the Atlantic coast the aborigines, at
the time of the Discovery, might have been divided into six or seven
groups, of which three were situated mainly to the east of the
Mississippi river, the others mainly to the west of it.
<span class="sidenote">The Dakota family of tribes.</span>
All were in the
lower period of barbarism. Of the western groups, by far the most
numerous were the Dakotas, comprising the Sioux, Poncas, Omahas, Iowas,
Kaws, Otoes, and Missouris. From the headwaters of the Mississippi their
territory extended westward on both sides of the Missouri for a thousand
miles. One of their tribes, the Winnebagos, had crossed the Mississippi
and pressed into the region between that river and Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>A second group, very small in numbers but extremely interesting to the
student of ethnology, comprises the Minnitarees and Mandans on the upper
Missouri.<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35" title="Go to footnote 35"><span class="small">[35]</span></a> The remnants of these tribes now live together in the same
village, and in personal appearance, as well as in intelligence, they
are described as superior to any other red men <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> north of New
Mexico. From their first discovery, by the brothers La Vérendrye in
1742, <span class="sidenote">The Minnitarees and Mandans.</span>
down to Mr. Catlin's visit nearly a century later, there was no
change in their condition,<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36" title="Go to footnote 36"><span class="small">[36]</span></a> but shortly afterward, in 1838, the
greater part of them were swept away by small-pox. The excellence of
their horticulture, the framework of their houses, and their peculiar
religious ceremonies early attracted attention. Upon Mr. Catlin they
made such an impression that he fancied there must be an infusion of
white blood in them; and after the fashion of those days he sought to
account for it by a reference to the legend of Madoc, a Welsh prince who
was dimly imagined to have sailed to America about 1170. He thought that
Madoc's party might have sailed to the Mississippi and founded a colony
which ascended that river and the Ohio, built the famous mounds of the
Ohio valley, and finally migrated to the upper Missouri.<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37" title="Go to footnote 37"><span class="small">[37]</span></a> To this
speculation was appended the inevitable list of words which happen to
sound somewhat alike in Mandan and in Welsh. In the realm of free fancy
everything is easy. That there was a Madoc who went somewhere in 1170 is
quite possible, but as shrewd old John Smith said about it, "where this
place was no history can show."<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38" title="Go to footnote 38"><span class="small">[38]</span></a> But one <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span> part of Mr.
Catlin's speculation may have hit somewhat nearer the truth. It is
possible that the Minnitarees or the Mandans, or both, may be a remnant
of some of those Mound-builders in the Mississippi valley concerning
whom something will presently be said.</p>

<p>The third group in this western region consists of the Pawnees
<span class="sidenote">Pawnees, etc.</span>
and
Arickarees,<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39" title="Go to footnote 39"><span class="small">[39]</span></a> of the Platte valley in Nebraska, with a few kindred
tribes farther to the south.</p>

<p>Of the three groups eastward of the Mississippi we may first mention the
Maskoki,<span class="sidenote">Maskoki family.</span>
 or Muskhogees, consisting of the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Seminoles, and others, with the Creek confederacy.<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40" title="Go to footnote 40"><span class="small">[40]</span></a> These tribes were
intelligent and powerful, with a culture well advanced toward the end of
the lower period of barbarism.</p>

<p>The Algonquin family, bordering at its southern limits upon the Maskoki,
had a vast range northeasterly along the Atlantic coast until it reached
the confines of Labrador, and northwesterly through the region of the
Great Lakes and as far as the Churchill river<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41" title="Go to footnote 41"><span class="small">[41]</span></a> to the west of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> Hudson's Bay. In other words, the Algonquins were bounded on
the south by the Maskoki,<span class="sidenote">Algonquin family of tribes.</span>
<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42" title="Go to footnote 42"><span class="small">[42]</span></a> on the west by the Dakotas, on the
northwest by the Athabaskans, on the northeast by Eskimos, and on the
east by the ocean. Between Lake Superior and the Red River of the North
the Crees had their hunting grounds, and closely related to them were
the Pottawatomies, Ojibwas, and Ottawas. One offshoot, including the
Blackfeet, Cheyennes, and Arrapahos, roamed as far west as the Rocky
Mountains. The great triangle between the upper Mississippi and the Ohio
was occupied by the Menomonees and Kickapoos, the Sacs and Foxes, the
Miamis and Illinois, and the Shawnees. Along the coast region the
principal Algonquin tribes were the Powhatans of Virginia, the Lenape or
Delawares, the Munsees or Minisinks of the mountains about the
Susquehanna, the Mohegans on the Hudson, the Adirondacks between that
river and the St. Lawrence, the Narragansetts and their congeners in New
England, and finally the Micmacs and Wabenaki far down East, as the last
name implies. There is a tradition, supported to some extent by
linguistic evidence,<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43" title="Go to footnote 43"><span class="small">[43]</span></a> that the Mohegans, with their cousins the
Pequots, were more closely related to the Shawnees than to the Delaware
or coast group. While all the Algonquin tribes were in the lower period
of barbarism, there was a noticeable gradation among them, the Crees
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> and Ojibwas of the far North standing lowest in culture, and
the Shawnees, at their southernmost limits, standing highest.</p>

<p>We have observed the Dakota tribes pressing eastward against their
neighbours and sending out an offshoot, the Winnebagos, across the
Mississippi river. <span class="sidenote">Huron-Iroquois family of tribes.</span>
It has been supposed that the Huron-Iroquois group of
tribes was a more remote offshoot from the Dakotas. This is very
doubtful; but in the thirteenth or fourteenth century the general trend
of the Huron-Iroquois movement seems to have been eastward, either in
successive swarms, or in a single swarm, which became divided and
scattered by segmentation, as was common with all Indian tribes. They
seem early to have proved their superiority over the Algonquins in
bravery and intelligence. Their line of invasion seems to have run
eastward to Niagara, and thereabouts to have bifurcated, one line
following the valley of the St. Lawrence, and the other that of the
Susquehanna. The Hurons established themselves in the peninsula between
the lake that bears their name and Lake Ontario. South of them and along
the northern shore of Lake Erie were settled their kindred, afterward
called the "Neutral Nation."<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44" title="Go to footnote 44"><span class="small">[44]</span></a> On the southern shore the Eries planted
themselves, while the Susquehannocks pushed on in a direction
sufficiently described by their name. Farthest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span> of all
penetrated the Tuscaroras, even into the pine forests of North Carolina,
where they maintained themselves in isolation from their kindred until
1715. These invasions resulted in some displacement of Algonquin tribes,
and began to sap the strength of the confederacy or alliance in which
the Delawares had held a foremost place.</p>

<p>But by far the most famous and important of the Huron-Iroquois were
those that followed the northern shore of Lake Ontario into the valley
of the St. Lawrence. In that direction their progress was checked by the
Algonquin tribe of Adirondacks, but they succeeded in retaining a
foothold in the country for a long time; for in 1535 Jacques Cartier
found on the site which he named Montreal an Iroquois village which had
vanished before Champlain's arrival seventy years later. Those Iroquois
who were thrust back in the struggle for the St. Lawrence valley, early
in the fifteenth century, made their way across Lake Ontario and
established themselves at the mouth of the Oswego river. They were then
in three small tribes,&mdash;the Mohawks, Onondagas, and Senecas,&mdash;but as
they grew in numbers and spread eastward to the Hudson and westward to
the Genesee, the intermediate tribes of Oneidas and Cayugas were formed
by segmentation.<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45" title="Go to footnote 45"><span class="small">[45]</span></a> About 1450 the five tribes&mdash;afterwards known as the
Five Nations&mdash;were
<span class="sidenote">The Five Nations.</span>
joined in a confederacy in pursuance of the wise
counsel which Hayowentha, or Hiawatha,<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46" title="Go to footnote 46"><span class="small">[46]</span></a> according to the legend,
whispered into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span> the ears of the Onondaga sachem, Daganoweda.
This union of their resources combined, with their native bravery and
cunning, and their occupation of the most commanding military position
in eastern North America, to render them invincible among red men. They
exterminated their old enemies the Adirondacks, and pushed the Mohegans
over the mountains from the Hudson river to the Connecticut. When they
first encountered white men in 1609 their name had become a terror in
New England, insomuch that as soon as a single Mohawk was caught sight
of by the Indians in that country, they would raise the cry from hill to
hill, "A Mohawk! a Mohawk!" and forthwith would flee like sheep before
wolves, never dreaming of resistance.<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47" title="Go to footnote 47"><span class="small">[47]</span></a></p>

<p>After the Five Nations had been supplied with firearms by the Dutch
their power increased with portentous rapidity.<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48" title="Go to footnote 48"><span class="small">[48]</span></a> At first they sought
to persuade their neighbours of kindred blood and speech, the Eries and
others, to join their confederacy; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> and failing in this they
went to war and exterminated them.<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49" title="Go to footnote 49"><span class="small">[49]</span></a> Then they overthrew one Algonquin
tribe after another until in 1690 their career was checked by the
French. By that time they had reduced to a tributary condition most of
the Algonquin tribes, even to the Mississippi river. Some writers have
spoken of the empire of the Iroquois, and it has been surmised that, if
they had not been interfered with by white men, they might have played a
part analogous to that of the Romans in the Old World; but there is no
real similarity between the two cases. The Romans acquired their mighty
strength by incorporating vanquished peoples into their own body
politic.<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50" title="Go to footnote 50"><span class="small">[50]</span></a> No American aborigines ever had a glimmering of the process
of state-building after the Roman fashion. No incorporation resulted
from the victories of the Iroquois. Where their burnings and massacres
stopped short of extermination, they simply took tribute, which was as
far as state-craft had got in the lower period of barbarism. General
Walker has summed up their military career in a single sentence: "They
were the scourge of God upon the aborigines of the continent."<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51" title="Go to footnote 51"><span class="small">[51]</span></a></p>

<p>The six groups here enumerated&mdash;Dakota, Mandan, Pawnee, Maskoki,
Algonquin, Iroquois&mdash;made <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span> up the great body of the aborigines
of North America who at the time of the Discovery lived in the lower
status of barbarism. All made pottery of various degrees of rudeness.
Their tools and weapons were of the Neolithic type,&mdash;stone
<span class="sidenote">Horticulture must be distinguished from field agriculture.</span>
either
polished or accurately and artistically chipped. For the most part they
lived in stockaded villages, and cultivated maize, beans, pumpkins,
squashes, sunflowers, and tobacco. They depended for subsistence partly
upon such vegetable products, partly upon hunting and fishing, the women
generally attending to the horticulture, the men to the chase.
<i>Horticulture</i> is an appropriate designation for this stage in which the
ground is merely scratched with stone spades and hoes. It is incipient
agriculture, but should be carefully distinguished from the <i>field
agriculture</i> in which extensive pieces of land are subdued by the
plough. The assistance of domestic animals is needed before such work
can be carried far, and it does not appear that there was an approach to
field agriculture in any part of pre-Columbian America except Peru,
where men were harnessed to the plough, and perhaps occasionally llamas
were used in the same way.<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52" title="Go to footnote 52"><span class="small">[52]</span></a> Where subsistence depended upon rude
horticulture eked out by game and fish, it required a large territory to
support a sparse population. The great diversity of languages
contributed to maintain the isolation of tribes and prevent extensive
confederation. Intertribal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span> warfare was perpetual, save now and
then for truces of brief duration. Warfare was attended by wholesale
massacre. <span class="sidenote">Perpetual warfare.</span>
As many prisoners as could be managed were taken home by their
captors; in some cases they were adopted into the tribe of the latter as
a means of increasing its fighting strength, otherwise they were put to
death with lingering torments.<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53" title="Go to footnote 53"><span class="small">[53]</span></a> There was nothing which afforded the
red men such exquisite delight as the spectacle of live human flesh
lacerated with stone knives or hissing under the touch of firebrands,
and for elaborate ingenuity in devising tortures they have never been
equalled.<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href="#footnote54" title="Go to footnote 54"><span class="small">[54]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span> Cannibalism was quite commonly practised.<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55" title="Go to footnote 55"><span class="small">[55]</span></a>
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span> scalps of slain enemies were always taken, and until they
had attained such trophies the young men were not likely to find favour
in the eyes of women. The Indian's notions of morality were those that
belong to that state of society in which the tribe is the largest
well-established political aggregate. Murder without the tribe was
meritorious unless it entailed risk of war at an obvious disadvantage;
murder within the tribe was either revenged by blood-feud or compounded
by a present given to the victim's kinsmen. Such rudimentary <i>wergild</i>
was often reckoned in wampum, or strings of beads made of a kind of
mussel shell, and put to divers uses, as personal ornament, mnemonic
record, and finally money. Religious thought was in the fetishistic or
animistic stage,<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56" title="Go to footnote 56"><span class="small">[56]</span></a> while many tribes had risen to a vague conception
of tutelar deities embodied in human or animal forms. Myth-tales
abounded, and the folk-lore of the red men is found to be extremely
interesting and instructive.<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57" title="Go to footnote 57"><span class="small">[57]</span></a> Their religion consisted mainly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span> in a devout belief in witchcraft. No well-defined priestly
class had been evolved; the so-called "medicine men" were mere
conjurers, though possessed of considerable influence.</p>

<p>But none of the characteristics of barbarous society above specified
will carry us so far toward realizing the gulf which divides it from
civilized society as the imperfect development of its domestic
relations. The importance of this subject is such as to call for a few
words of special elucidation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thirty years ago, when Sir Henry Maine published that magnificent
treatise on Ancient Law, which, when considered in all its potency of
suggestiveness, has perhaps done more than any other single book of our
century toward placing the study of history upon a scientific basis,
<span class="sidenote">Ancient Law.</span>
he
began by showing that in primitive society the individual is nothing and
the state nothing, while the family-group is everything, and that the
progress of civilization politically has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span> consisted on the one
hand in the aggregation and building up of family-groups through
intermediate tribal organizations into states, and on the other hand in
the disentanglement of individuals from the family thraldom. In other
words, we began by having no political communities larger than clans,
and no bond of political union except blood relationship, and in this
state of things the individual, as to his rights and obligations, was
submerged in the clan. We at length come to have great nations like the
English or the French, in which blood-relationship as a bond of
political union is no longer indispensable or even much thought of, and
in which the individual citizen is the possessor of legal rights and
subject to legal obligations. No one in our time can forget how
beautifully Sir Henry Maine, with his profound knowledge of early Aryan
law and custom, from Ireland to Hindustan, delineated the slow growth of
individual ownership of property and individual responsibility for
delict and crime out of an earlier stage in which ownership and
responsibility belonged only to family-groups or clans.</p>

<p>In all these brilliant studies Sir Henry Maine started with the
patriarchal family as we find it at the dawn of history among all
peoples of Aryan and Semitic speech,&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">The patriarchal family not primitive.</span>
patriarchal family of the
ancient Roman and the ancient Jew, the family in which kinship is
reckoned through males, and in which all authority centres in the eldest
male, and descends to his eldest son. Maine treated this patriarchal
family as primitive; but his great book had hardly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span> appeared
when other scholars, more familiar than he with races in savagery or in
the lower status of barbarism, showed that his view was too restricted.
We do not get back to primitive society by studying Greeks, Romans, and
Jews, peoples who had nearly emerged from the later period of barbarism
when we first know them.<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58" title="Go to footnote 58"><span class="small">[58]</span></a> Their patriarchal family was perfected in
shape during the later period of barbarism, and it was preceded by a
much ruder and less definite form of family-group in which kinship was
reckoned only through the mother, and the headship never descended from
father to son. As so often happens, this discovery was made almost
simultaneously by two investigators, each working in ignorance of what
the other was doing. In 1861, the same year in which "Ancient Law" was
published, <span class="sidenote">"Mother-right."</span>
Professor Bachofen, of Basel, published his famous book, "Das
Mutterrecht," of which his co-discoverer and rival, after taking
exception to some of his statements, thus cordially writes: "It remains,
however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> after all qualifications and deductions, that
Bachofen, before any one else, discovered the fact that a system of
kinship through mothers only, had anciently everywhere prevailed before
the tie of blood between father and child had found a place in systems
of relationships. And the honour of that discovery, the importance of
which, as affording a new starting-point for all history, cannot be
overestimated, must without stint or qualification be assigned to
him."<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59" title="Go to footnote 59"><span class="small">[59]</span></a> Such are the generous words of the late John Ferguson
McLennan, who had no knowledge of Bachofen's work when his own treatise
on "Primitive Marriage" was published in 1865. Since he was so modest in
urging his own claims, it is due to the Scotch lawyer's memory to say
that, while he was inferior in point of erudition to the Swiss
professor, <span class="sidenote">Primitive marriage.</span>
his book is characterized by greater sagacity, goes more
directly to the mark, and is less encumbered by visionary speculations
of doubtful value.<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60" title="Go to footnote 60"><span class="small">[60]</span></a> Mr. McLennan proved, from evidence collected
chiefly from Australians and South Sea Islanders, and sundry non-Aryan
tribes of Hindustan and Thibet, that systems of kinship in which the
father is ignored exist to-day, and he furthermore discovered
unmistakable and very significant traces of the former existence of such
a state of things among the Mongols, the Greeks and Ph&oelig;nicians, and
the ancient Hebrews. By those who were inclined to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> regard Sir
Henry Maine's views as final, it was argued that Mr. McLennan's facts
were of a sporadic and exceptional character. But when the evidence from
this vast archaic world of America began to be gathered in and
interpreted by Mr. Morgan, this argument fell to the ground, and as to
the point chiefly in contention, Mr. McLennan was proved to be right.
<span class="sidenote">The system of reckoning kinship through females only.</span>
Throughout aboriginal America, with one or two exceptions, kinship was
reckoned through females only, and in the exceptional instances the
vestiges of that system were so prominent as to make it clear that the
change had been but recently effected. During the past fifteen years,
evidence has accumulated from various parts of the world, until it is
beginning to appear as if it were the patriarchal system that is
exceptional, having been reached only by the highest races.<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61" title="Go to footnote 61"><span class="small">[61]</span></a> Sir
Henry Maine's work has lost none of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span> its value, only, like all
human work, it is not final; it needs to be supplemented by the further
study of savagery as best exemplified in Australia and some parts of
Polynesia, and of barbarism as best exemplified in America. The subject
is, moreover, one of great and complicated difficulty, and leads
incidentally to many questions for solving which the data at our command
are still inadequate. It is enough for us now to observe in general that
while there are plenty of instances of change from the system of
reckoning kinship only through females, to the system of reckoning
through males, there do not appear to have been any instances of change
in the reverse direction; and that in ancient America the earlier system
was prevalent.</p>

<p>If now we ask the reason for such a system of reckoning kinship and
inheritance, so strange according to all our modern notions,
<span class="sidenote">Original reason for the system.</span>
the true
answer doubtless is that which was given by prudent
(&#928;&#949;&#928;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;)
Telemachus to the goddess Athene when she asked him to tell her truly if
he was the son of Odysseus:&mdash;"My mother says I am his son, for my part,
I don't know; one never knows of one's self who one's father is."<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62" title="Go to footnote 62"><span class="small">[62]</span></a>
Already, no doubt, in Homer's time <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> there was a gleam of satire
about this answer, such as it would show on a modern page; but in more
primitive times it was a very serious affair. From what we know of the
ideas and practices of uncivilized tribes all over the world, it is
evident that the sacredness of the family based upon indissoluble
marriage is a thing of comparatively modern growth. If the sexual
relations of the Australians, as observed to-day,<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63" title="Go to footnote 63"><span class="small">[63]</span></a> are an improvement
upon an antecedent state of things,
<span class="sidenote">The primeval human horde.</span>
that antecedent state must have been
sheer promiscuity. There is ample warrant for supposing, with Mr.
McLennan, that at the beginning of the lower status of savagery, long
since everywhere extinct, the family had not made itself distinctly
visible, but men lived in a horde very much like gregarious brutes.<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64" title="Go to footnote 64"><span class="small">[64]</span></a>
I have shown that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> the essential difference between this
primeval human horde and a mere herd of brutes consisted in the fact
that the gradual but very great prolongation of infancy had produced two
effects: the lengthening of the care of children tended to differentiate
the horde into family-groups, and the lengthening of the period of
youthful mental plasticity made it more possible for a new generation to
improve upon the ideas and customs of its predecessors.<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65" title="Go to footnote 65"><span class="small">[65]</span></a> In these two
concomitant processes&mdash;the development of the family and the increase of
mental plasticity, or ability to adopt new methods and strike out into
new paths of thought&mdash;lies the whole explanation of the moral and
intellectual superiority of men over dumb animals. But in each case the
change was very gradual.<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66" title="Go to footnote 66"><span class="small">[66]</span></a> The true savage is only a little less
unteachable than the beasts of the field. The savage family is at first
barely discernible amid the primitive social chaos <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> in which it
had its origin. Along with polyandry and polygyny in various degrees and
forms, instances of exclusive pairing, of at least a temporary
character, are to be found among the lowest existing savages,
<span class="sidenote">Earliest family-group: the clan.</span>
and there
are reasons for supposing that such may have been the case even in
primeval times. But it was impossible for strict monogamy to flourish in
the ruder stages of social development; and the kind of family-group
that was first clearly and permanently differentiated from the primeval
horde was not at all like what civilized people would recognize as a
family. It was the <i>gens</i> or <i>clan</i>, as we find it exemplified in all
stages from the middle period of savagery to the middle period of
barbarism. The <i>gens</i> or <i>clan</i> was simply&mdash;to define it by a third
synonym&mdash;the <i>kin</i>; it was originally a group of males and females who
were traditionally aware of their common descent reckoned in the female
line. <span class="sidenote">"Exogamy."</span>
At this stage of development there was quite generally though not
universally prevalent the custom of "exogamy," by which a man was
forbidden to marry a woman of his own clan. Among such Australian tribes
as have been studied, this primitive restriction upon promiscuity seems
to be about the only one.</p>

<p>Throughout all the earlier stages of culture, and even into the
civilized period, we find society organized with the clan for its
ultimate unit, although in course of time its character becomes greatly
altered by the substitution of kinship in the paternal, for that in the
maternal line. By <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span> long-continued growth and repeated
segmentation the primitive clan was developed into a more complex
structure, in which a group of clans constituted a
<span class="sidenote">Phratry and tribe.</span>
<i>phratry</i> or
brotherhood, and a group of phratries constituted a <i>tribe</i>. This
threefold grouping is found so commonly in all parts of the world as to
afford good ground for the belief that it has been universal. It was
long ago familiar to historians in the case of Greece and Rome, and of
our Teutonic forefathers,<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67" title="Go to footnote 67"><span class="small">[67]</span></a> but it also existed generally in ancient
America, and many obscure points connected with the history of the Greek
and Roman groups have been elucidated through the study of Iroquois and
Algonquin institutions. Along with the likenesses, however, there are
numerous unlikenesses, due to the change of kinship, among the European
groups, from the female line to the male.</p>

<p>This change, as it occurred among Aryan and Semitic peoples, marked one
of the most momentous revolutions in the history of mankind. It probably
occurred early in the upper period of barbarism, or late in the middle
period, after the long-continued domestication of animals had resulted
in the acquisition of private property (<i>pecus, peculium, pecunia</i>) in
large amounts by individuals.
<span class="sidenote">Effect of pastoral life upon property and upon the family.</span>
In primitive society there was very little
personal property except in weapons, clothing (such as it was), and
trinkets. Real estate was unknown. Land was simply <i>occupied</i> by the
tribe. There was general communism and social equality. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span> In the
Old World the earliest instance of extensive "adverse possession" on the
part of individuals, as against other individuals in the clan-community,
was the possession of flocks and herds. Distinctions in wealth and rank
were thus inaugurated; slavery began to be profitable and personal
retainers and adherents useful in new ways. As in earlier stages the
community in marital relations had been part of the general community in
possessions, so now the exclusive possession of a wife or wives was part
of the system of private property that was coming into vogue. The man of
many cattle, the man who could attach subordinates to him through
motives of self-interest as well as personal deference, the man who
could defend his property against robbers, could also have his separate
household and maintain its sanctity. In this way, it is believed,
indissoluble marriage, in its two forms of monogamy and polygamy,
originated. That it had already existed sporadically is not denied, but
it now acquired such stability and permanence that the older and looser
forms of alliance, hitherto prevalent, fell into disfavour. A natural
result of the growth of private wealth and the permanence of the marital
relation was the change in reckoning kinship from the maternal to the
paternal line. This change was probably favoured by the prevalence of
polygamy among those who were coming to be distinguished as "upper
classes," since a large family of children by different mothers could be
held together only by reckoning the kinship through the father. Thus, we
may suppose, originated the patriarchal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> family. Even in its
rudest form it was an immense improvement upon what had gone before, and
to the stronger and higher social organization thus acquired we must
largely ascribe the rise of the Aryan and Semitic peoples to the
foremost rank of civilization.<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68" title="Go to footnote 68"><span class="small">[68]</span></a></p>

<p>It is not intended to imply that there is no other way in which the
change to the male line may have been brought about among other peoples.
The explanation just given applies very well to the Aryan and Semitic
peoples, but it is inapplicable to the state of things which seems to
have existed in Mexico at the time of the Discovery.<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69" title="Go to footnote 69"><span class="small">[69]</span></a> The subject is
a difficult one, and sometimes confronts us with questions much easier
to ask than to answer. The change has been observed among tribes in a
lower stage than that just described.<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70" title="Go to footnote 70"><span class="small">[70]</span></a> On the other hand, as old
customs die hard, no doubt inheritance has in many places continued in
the maternal line long after paternity is fully known. Symmetrical
regularity in the development of human institutions has by no means been
the rule, and there is often much difficulty in explaining particular
cases, even when the direction of the general drift can be discerned.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span>

<p>In aboriginal America, as already observed, kinship through females only
was the rule,
<span class="sidenote">The exogamous clan in ancient America.</span>
and exogamy was strictly enforced,&mdash;the wife must be taken
from a different clan. Indissoluble marriage, whether monogamous or
polygamous, seems to have been unknown. The marriage relation was
terminable at the will of either party.<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71" title="Go to footnote 71"><span class="small">[71]</span></a> The abiding unit upon which
the social structure was founded was not the family but the exogamous
clan.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have been at some pains to elucidate this point because the house-life
of the American aborigines found visible, and in some instances very
durable, expression in a remarkable style of house-architecture. The
manner in which the Indians built their houses grew directly out of the
requirements of their life. It was an unmistakably characteristic
architecture, and while it exhibits <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span> manifold unlikenesses in
detail, due to differences in intelligence as well as to the presence or
absence of sundry materials,
<span class="sidenote">Intimate connection of aboriginal architecture with social
life.</span>
there is one underlying principle always
manifest. That underlying principle is adaptation to a certain mode of
communal living such as all American aborigines that have been carefully
studied are known to have practised. Through many gradations, from the
sty of the California savage up to the noble sculptured ruins of Uxmal
and Chichen-Itza, the principle is always present. Taken in connection
with evidence from other sources, it enables us to exhibit a gradation
of stages of culture in aboriginal North America, with the savages of
the Sacramento and Columbia valleys at the bottom, and the Mayas of
Yucatan at the top; and while in going from one end to the other a very
long interval was traversed, we feel that the progress of the aborigines
in crossing that interval was made along similar lines.<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href="#footnote72" title="Go to footnote 72"><span class="small">[72]</span></a></p>

<p>Ground-plan of long house.</p>
</div>

<p>The principle was first studied and explained by Mr. Morgan in the case
of the famous "long houses" of the Iroquois. "The long house ... was
from fifty to eighty and sometimes one hundred feet long. It consisted
of a strong frame of upright poles set in the ground, which was
strengthened with horizontal poles attached with withes, and surmounted
with a triangular, and in some cases with a round roof. It was covered
over, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span> both sides and roof, with long strips of elm bark tied
to the frame with strings or splints. An external frame of poles for the
sides and of rafters for the roof were then adjusted to hold the bark
shingles between them, the two frames being tied together.
<span class="sidenote">The long houses of the Iroquois.</span>
The interior
of the house was comparted<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73" title="Go to footnote 73"><span class="small">[73]</span></a> at intervals of six or eight feet,
leaving each chamber entirely open like a stall upon the passageway
which passed through the centre of the house from end to end. At each
end was a doorway covered with suspended skins. Between each four
apartments, two on a side, was a fire-pit in the centre of the hall,
used in common by their occupants. Thus a house with five fires would
contain twenty apartments <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span> and accommodate twenty families,
unless some apartments were reserved for storage. They were warm, roomy,
and tidily-kept habitations. Raised bunks were constructed around the
walls of each apartment for beds. From the roof-poles were suspended
their strings of corn in the ear, braided by the husks, also strings of
dried squashes and pumpkins. Spaces were contrived here and there to
store away their accumulations of provisions. Each house, as a rule, was
occupied by related families, the mothers and their children belonging
to the same gens, while their husbands and the fathers of these children
belonged to other gentes; consequently the gens or clan of the mother
largely predominated in the household. Whatever was taken in the hunt or
raised by cultivation by any member of the household ... was for the
common benefit. Provisions were made a common stock within the
household."<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href="#footnote74" title="Go to footnote 74"><span class="small">[74]</span></a></p>

<p>"Over every such household a matron presided, whose duty it was to
supervise its domestic economy. After the single daily meal had been
cooked at the different fires within the house, it was her province to
divide the food from the kettle to the several families according to
their respective needs. What remained was placed in the custody of
another person until she again required it."<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75" title="Go to footnote 75"><span class="small">[75]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span>

<p>Not only the food was common property, but many chattels, including the
children, belonged to the gens or clan. When a young woman got married
she brought her husband home with her. Though thenceforth an inmate of
this household he remained an alien to her clan. "If he proved lazy and
failed to do his share of the providing, woe be to him.
<span class="sidenote">Summary divorce.</span>
No matter how
many children, or whatever goods he might have in the house, he might at
any time be ordered to pick up his blanket and budge; and after such
orders it would not be healthful for him to disobey; the house would be
too hot for him; and unless saved by the intercession of some aunt or
grandmother [of his wife] he must retreat to his own clan, or, as was
often done, go and start a new matrimonial alliance in some other....
The female portion ruled the house."<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76" title="Go to footnote 76"><span class="small">[76]</span></a></p>

<p>Though there was but one freshly-cooked meal, taken about the middle of
the day, any member of the household when hungry could be helped from
the common stock. Hospitality was universal. If a person from one of the
other communal households, or a stranger from another tribe (in time of
peace), <span class="sidenote">Hospitality.</span>
were to visit the house, the women would immediately offer him
food, and it was a breach of etiquette to decline to eat it. This custom
was strictly observed all over the continent and in the West India
Islands, and was often remarked upon by the early discoverers, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> whose minds it was apt to implant idyllic notions that were
afterward rudely disturbed. The prevalence of hospitality among
uncivilized races has long been noted by travellers, and is probably in
most cases, as it certainly was in ancient America, closely connected
with communism in living.</p>

<p>The clan, which practised this communism, had its definite organization,
officers, rights, and duties. Its official head was the "sachem," whose
functions were of a civil nature. The sachem was elected by the clan and
must be a member of it, so that a son could not be chosen to succeed his
father, <span class="sidenote">Structure of the clan.</span>
but a sachem could be succeeded by his uterine brother or by his
sister's son, and in this way customary lines of succession could and
often did tend to become established. The clan also elected its
"chiefs," whose functions were military; the number of chiefs was
proportionate to that of the people composing the clan, usually one
chief to every fifty or sixty persons. The clan could depose its sachem
or any of its chiefs. Personal property, such as weapons, or trophies,
or rights of user in the garden-plots, was inheritable in the female
line, and thus stayed within the clan. The members were reciprocally
bound to help, defend, and avenge one another. The clan had the right of
adopting strangers to strengthen itself. It had the right of naming its
members, and these names were always obviously significant, like Little
Turtle, Yellow Wolf, etc.; of names like our Richard or William, with
the meaning lost, or obvious only to scholars, no trace is to be found
in aboriginal America. The clan <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> itself, too, always had a
name, which was usually that of some animal,&mdash;as Wolf, Eagle, or Salmon,
and a rude drawing or pictograph of the creature served as a "totem" or
primitive heraldic device. A mythological meaning was attached to this
emblem. The clan had its own common religious rites and common burial
place. There was a clan-council, of which women might be members; there
were instances, indeed, of its being composed entirely of women, whose
position was one of much more dignity and influence than has commonly
been supposed. Instances of squaw sachems were not so very rare.<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77" title="Go to footnote 77"><span class="small">[77]</span></a></p>

<p>The number of clans in a tribe naturally bore some proportion to the
populousness of the tribe, varying from three, in the case of the
Delawares, to twenty or more, as in the case of the Ojibwas and Creeks.
There were usually eight or ten, and these were usually grouped into two
or three phratries. <span class="sidenote">Origin and structure of the phratry.</span>
The phratry seems to have originated in the
segmentation of the overgrown clan, for in some cases exogamy was
originally practised as between the phratries and afterward the custom
died out while it was retained as between their constituent clans.<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78" title="Go to footnote 78"><span class="small">[78]</span></a>
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span> system of naming often indicates this origin of the
phratry, though seldom quite so forcibly as in the case of the Mohegan
tribe, which was thus composed:<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79" title="Go to footnote 79"><span class="small">[79]</span></a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noindent">Here the senior clan in the phratry tends to keep
the original clan-name, while the junior clans have been guided by a
sense of kinship in choosing their new names. This origin of the phratry
is further indicated by the fact that the phratry does not always occur;
sometimes the clans are organized directly into the tribe. The phratry
was not so much a governmental as a religious and social organization.
Its most important function seems to have been supplementing or
reinforcing the action of the single clan in exacting compensation for
murder; and this point is full of interest because it helps us to
understand how among our Teutonic forefathers the "hundred" (the
equivalent of the phratry) became charged with the duty of prosecuting
criminals. The Greek phratry had a precisely analogous function.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80" title="Go to footnote 80"><span class="small">[80]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span>

<p>The Indian tribe was a group of people distinguished by the exclusive
possession of a dialect in common.
<span class="sidenote">Structure of the tribe.</span>
It possessed a tribal name and
occupied a more or less clearly defined territory; there were also
tribal religious rites. Its supreme government was vested in the council
of its clan-chiefs and sachems; and as these were thus officers of the
tribe as well as of the clan, the tribe exercised the right of investing
them with office, amid appropriate solemnities, after their election by
their respective clans. The tribal-council had also the right to depose
chiefs and sachems. In some instances, not always, there was a head
chief or military commander for the tribes, elected by the tribal
council. Such, was the origin of the office which, in most societies of
the Old World, gradually multiplied its functions and accumulated power
until it developed into true kingship. Nowhere in ancient North America
did it quite reach such a stage.</p>

<p>Among the greater part of the aborigines no higher form of social
structure was attained than the tribe.
<span class="sidenote">Cross-relationships between clans and tribes: the Iroquois
Confederacy.</span>
There were, however, several
instances of permanent confederation, of which the two most interesting
and most highly developed were the League of the Iroquois, mentioned
above, and the Mexican Confederacy, presently to be considered. The
principles upon which the Iroquois league <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> was founded have
been thoroughly and minutely explained by Mr. Morgan.<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81" title="Go to footnote 81"><span class="small">[81]</span></a> It originated
in a union of five tribes composed of clans in common, and speaking five
dialects of a common language. These tribes had themselves arisen
through the segmentation of a single overgrown tribe, so that portions
of the original clans survived in them all. The Wolf, Bear, and Turtle
clan were common to all the five tribes; three other clans were common
to three of the five. "All the members of the same gens [clan], whether
Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, or Senecas, were brothers and
sisters to each other in virtue of their descent from the same common
[female] ancestor, and they recognized each other as such with the
fullest cordiality. When they met, the first inquiry was the name of
each other's gens, and next the immediate pedigree of each other's
sachems; after which they were able to find, under their peculiar system
of consanguinity, the relationship in which they stood to each other....
This cross-relationship between persons of the same gens in the
different tribes is still preserved and recognized among them in all its
original force. It explains the tenacity with which the fragments of the
old confederacy still cling together."<a id="footnotetag82" name="footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82" title="Go to footnote 82"><span class="small">[82]</span></a> Acknowledged <span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span>
consanguinity is to the barbarian a sound reason, and the only one
conceivable, for permanent political union; and the very existence of
such a confederacy as that of the Five Nations was rendered possible
only through the permanence of the clans or communal households which
were its ultimate units. We have here a clue to the policy of these
Indians toward the kindred tribes who refused to join their league.
These tribes, too, so far as is known, would seem to have contained the
same clans. After a separation of at least four hundred years the
Wyandots have still five of their eight clans in common with the
Iroquois. When the Eries and other tribes would not join the league of
their kindred, the refusal smacked of treason to the kin, and we can
quite understand the deadly fury with which the latter turned upon them
and butchered every man, woman, and child except such as they saw fit to
adopt into their own clans.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span>

<p>Each of the Five Tribes retained its local self-government. The supreme
government of the confederacy was vested in a General Council of fifty
sachems, "equal in rank and authority." The fifty sachemships were
created in perpetuity in certain clans of the several tribes; whenever a
vacancy occurred, it was filled by the clan electing one of its own
members; <span class="sidenote">Structure of the confederacy.</span>
a sachem once thus elected could be deposed by the clan-council
for good cause; "but the right to invest these sachems with office was
reserved to the General Council." These fifty sachems of the confederacy
were likewise sachems in their respective tribes, "and with the chiefs
of these tribes formed the council of each, which was supreme over all
matters pertaining to the tribe exclusively." The General Council could
not convene itself, but could be convened by any one of the five tribal
councils. The regular meeting was once a year in the autumn, in the
valley of Onondaga, but in stirring times extra sessions were frequent.
The proceedings were opened by an address from one of the sachems, "in
the course of which he thanked the Great Spirit [i. e. Ioskeha, the
sky-god] for sparing their lives and permitting them to meet together;"
after this they were ready for business. It was proper for any orator
from among the people to address the Council with arguments, and the
debates were sometimes very long and elaborate. When it came to voting,
the fifty sachems voted by tribes, each tribe counting as a unit, and
unanimity was as imperative as in an English jury, so that one tribe
could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span> block the proceedings. The confederacy had no
head-sachem, or civil chief-magistrate; but a military commander was
indispensable, and, curiously enough, without being taught by the
experience of a Tarquin, the Iroquois made this a dual office, like the
Roman consulship. There were two permanent chieftainships, one in the
Wolf, the other in the Turtle clan, and both in the Seneca tribe,
because the western border was the most exposed to attack.<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83" title="Go to footnote 83"><span class="small">[83]</span></a> The
chiefs were elected by the clan, and inducted into office by the General
Council; their tenure was during life or good behaviour. This office
never encroached upon the others in its powers, but an able warrior in
this position could wield great influence.</p>

<p>Such was the famous confederacy of the Iroquois. They called it the Long
House,
<span class="sidenote">The "Long House."</span>
and by this name as commonly as any other it is known in history.
The name by which they called themselves was Hodenosaunee, or "People of
the Long House." The name was picturesquely descriptive of the long and
narrow strip of villages with its western outlook toward the Niagara,
and its eastern toward the Hudson, three hundred miles distant. But it
was appropriate also for another and a deeper reason than this. We have
seen that in its social and political <span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span> structure, from top to
bottom and from end to end, the confederacy was based upon and held
together by the gentes, clans, communal households, or "long houses,"
which were its component units. They may be compared to the hypothetical
indestructible atoms of modern physics, whereof all material objects are
composed. The whole institutional fabric was the outgrowth of the group
of ideas and habits that belong to a state of society ignorant of and
incapable of imagining any other form of organization than the clan held
together by the tie of a common maternal ancestry. The house
architecture was as much a constituent part of the fabric as the council
of sachems. There is a transparency about the system that is very
different from the obscurity we continually find in Europe and Asia,
where different strata of ideas and institutions have been superimposed
one upon another and crumpled and distorted with as little apparent
significance or purpose as the porches and gables of a so-called "Queen
Anne" house.<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84" title="Go to footnote 84"><span class="small">[84]</span></a> Conquest in the Old World has resulted in the
commingling and manifold fusion of peoples in very different stages of
development. In the New World there has been very little of that sort of
thing. Conquest in ancient America was pretty much all of the Iroquois
type, entailing in its milder form the imposition of tribute, in its
more desperate form the extermination of a tribe with the adoption of
its remnants into the similarly-constituted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span> tribe of the
conquerors. There was therefore but little modification of the social
structure while the people, gradually acquiring new arts, were passing
through savagery and into a more or less advanced stage of barbarism.
The symmetry of the structure and the relation of one institution to
another is thus distinctly apparent.</p>

<p>The communal household and the political structure built upon it, as
above described in the case of the Iroquois, seem to have existed all
over ancient North America, with agreement in fundamental
characteristics and variation in details and degree of development.
There are many corners as yet imperfectly explored, but hitherto, in so
far as research has been rewarded with information, it all points in the
same general direction. Among the tribes above enumerated as either in
savagery or in the lower status of barbarism, so far as they have been
studied, there seems to be a general agreement, as to the looseness of
the marriage tie the clan with descent in the female line, the
phratry, the tribe, the
officers and councils, the social equality, the community in goods (with
exceptions already noted), and the wigwam or house adapted to communal
living.</p>

<p>View, Cross-section, and Ground-plan of Mandan round
house.</p>
</div>

<p>The extreme of variation consistent with adherence to the common
principle was to be found in the shape and material of the houses. Those
of the savage tribes were but sorry huts. The long house was used by the
Powhatans and other Algonquin tribes. The other most highly developed
type may be illustrated by the circular frame-houses <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> of the
Mandans.<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85" title="Go to footnote 85"><span class="small">[85]</span></a>
These houses were from forty to sixty feet in diameter.
<span class="sidenote">Circular houses of the Mandans.</span>
A
dozen or more posts, each about eight inches in diameter, were set in
the ground, "at equal distances in the circumference of a circle, and
rising about six feet above the level of the floor." The tops of the
posts were connected by horizontal stringers; and outside each post a
slanting wooden brace sunk in the ground about four feet distant served
as a firm support to the structure. The spaces between these braces were
filled by tall wooden slabs, set with the same slant and resting against
the stringers. Thus the framework of the outer wall was completed. To
support the roof four posts were set in the ground about ten feet apart
in the form of a square, near the centre of the building. They were from
twelve to fifteen feet in height, and were connected at the top by four
stringers forming a square. The rafters rested upon these stringers and
upon the top of the circular wall below. The rafters were covered with
willow matting, and upon this was spread a layer of prairie grass. Then
both wall and roof, from the ground up to the summit, were covered with
earth, solid and hard, to a thickness of at least two feet. The rafters
projected above the square framework at the summit, so as to leave a
circular opening in the centre about four feet in diameter. This hole
let in a little light, and let out some of the smoke from the fire which
blazed underneath in a fire-pit lined with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span> stone slabs set on
edge. The only other aperture for light was the doorway, which was a
kind of vestibule or passage some ten feet in length. Curtains of
buffalo robes did duty instead of doors. The family compartments were
triangles with base at the outer wall, and apex opening upon the central
hearth; and the partitions were hanging mats or skins, which were
tastefully fringed and ornamented with quill-work and pictographs.<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86" title="Go to footnote 86"><span class="small">[86]</span></a>
In the lower Mandan village, visited by Catlin, there were about fifty
such houses, each able to accommodate from thirty to forty persons. The
village, situated upon a bold bluff at a bend of the Missouri river, and
surrounded by a palisade of stout timbers more than ten feet in height,
was very strong for defensive purposes. Indeed, it was virtually
impregnable to Indian methods of attack, for the earth-covered houses
could not be set on fire by blazing arrows, and just within the palisade
ran a trench in which the defenders could securely skulk, while through
the narrow chinks between the timbers they could shoot arrows fast
enough to keep their assailants at a distance. This purpose was further
secured by rude bastions, and considering the structure as a whole one
cannot help admiring the ingenuity which it exhibits. It shows a marked
superiority over the conceptions of military defence attained by the
Iroquois or any other Indians north of New Mexico. Besides the communal
houses the village contained its "medicine lodge," or council house, and
an open area for games and ceremonies. In the spaces <span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span> between
the houses were the scaffolds for drying maize, buffalo meat, etc.,
ascended by well-made portable ladders. Outside the village, at a short
distance on the prairie, was a group of such scaffolds upon which the
dead were left to moulder, somewhat after the fashion of the
Parsees.<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87" title="Go to footnote 87"><span class="small">[87]</span></a></p>

<hr>

<p>We are now prepared to understand some essential points in the life of
the groups of Indians occupying the region of the Cordilleras, both
north and south of the Isthmus of Darien, all the way from Zuñi to
Quito. <span class="sidenote">The Indians of the pueblos,&mdash;in the middle status of
barbarism.</span>
The principal groups are the Moquis and Zuñis of Arizona and New
Mexico, the Nahuas or Nahuatlac tribes of Mexico, the Mayas, Quichés,
and kindred peoples of Central America; and beyond the isthmus, the
Chibchas of New Granada, and sundry peoples comprised within the domain
of the Incas. With regard to the ethnic relationships of these various
groups, opinion is still in a state of confusion; but it is not
necessary for our present purpose that we should pause to discuss the
numerous questions thus arising. Our business is to get a clear notion
in outline of the character of the culture to which these peoples had
attained at the time of the Discovery. Here we observe, on the part of
all, a very considerable divergence from the average Indian level which
we have thus far been describing.</p>

<p>This divergence increases as we go from Zuñi toward Cuzco, reaching its
extreme, on the whole, among the Peruvians, though in some respects the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> nearest approach to civilization was made by the Mayas. All
these peoples were at least one full ethnical period nearer to true
civilization than the Iroquois,&mdash;and a vast amount of change and
improvement is involved in the conception of an entire ethnical period.
According to Mr. Morgan, one more such period would have brought the
average level of these Cordilleran peoples to as high a plane as that of
the Greeks described in the Odyssey. Let us now observe the principal
points involved in the change, bearing in mind that it implies a
considerable lapse of time. While the date 1325, at which the city of
Mexico was founded, is the earliest date in the history of that country
which can be regarded as securely established, it was preceded by a long
series of generations of migration and warfare, the confused and
fragmentary record of which historians have tried&mdash;hitherto with scant
success&mdash;to unravel. To develop such a culture as that of the Aztecs out
of an antecedent culture similar to that of the Iroquois must of course
have taken a long time.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the most conspicuous distinctive marks of the
grade of culture attained by the Cordilleran peoples were two,&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">Horticulture with irrigation, and architecture with adobe.</span>
cultivation of maize in large quantities by irrigation, and the use of
adobe-brick or stone in building. Probably there was at first, to some
extent, a causal connection between the former and the latter. The
region of the Moqui-Zuñi culture is a region in which arid plains become
richly fertile when water from neighbouring cliffs or peaks is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span>
directed down upon them. It is mainly an affair of sluices, not of pump
or well, which seem to have been alike beyond the ken of aboriginal
Americans of whatever grade. The change of occupation involved in
raising large crops of corn by the aid of sluices would facilitate an
increase in density of population, and would encourage a preference for
agricultural over predatory life. Such changes would be likely to favour
the development of defensive military art. The Mohawk's surest defence
lay in the terror which his prowess created hundreds of miles away. One
can easily see how the forefathers of our Moquis and Zuñis may have come
to prefer the security gained by living more closely together and
building impregnable fortresses.</p>

<p>The earthen wall of the Mandan, supported on a framework of posts and
slabs, seems to me curiously and strikingly suggestive of the incipient
pottery made by surrounding a basket with a coating of clay.<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href="#footnote88" title="Go to footnote 88"><span class="small">[88]</span></a> When it
was discovered how to make the earthen bowl or dish without the basket,
a new era in progress was begun. So when it was discovered that an
earthen wall could be fashioned to answer the requirements of
house-builders without the need of a permanent wooden framework, another
great step was taken. <span class="sidenote">Possible origin of adobe architecture.</span>
Again the consequences were great enough to make
it mark the beginning of a new ethnical period. If we suppose the
central portion of our continent, the Mississippi and Missouri valleys,
to have been occupied at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> some time by tribes familiar with the
Mandan style of building; and if we further suppose a gradual extension
or migration of this population, or some part of it, westward into the
mountain region; that would be a movement into a region in which timber
was scarce, while adobe clay was abundant. Under such circumstances the
useful qualities of that peculiar clay could not fail to be soon
discovered. The simple exposure to sunshine would quickly convert a
Mandan house built with it into an adobe house; the coating of earth
would become a coating of brick. It would not then take long to
ascertain that with such adobe-brick could be built walls at once light
and strong, erect and tall, such as could not be built with common clay.
In some such way as this I think the discovery must have been made by
the ancestors of the Zuñis, and others who have built pueblos. After the
pueblo style of architecture, with its erect walls and terraced stories,
had become developed, it was an easy step, when the occasion suggested
it, to substitute for the adobe-brick coarse rubble-stones embedded in
adobe. The final stage was reached in Mexico and Yucatan, when soft
coralline limestone was shaped into blocks with a flint chisel and laid
in courses with adobe-mortar.</p>

<p>The pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona are among the most interesting
structures in the world. Several are still inhabited by the descendants
of the people who were living in them at the time of the Spanish
Discovery, and their primitive customs and habits of thought have been
preserved to the present day with but little <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span> change. The long
sojourn of Mr. Cushing, <span class="sidenote">Mr. Cushing at Zuñi.</span>
of the Bureau of Ethnology, in the Zuñi pueblo,
has already thrown a flood of light upon many points in American
archæology.<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89" title="Go to footnote 89"><span class="small">[89]</span></a> As in the case of American aborigines generally, the
social life of these people is closely connected with their
architecture, and the pueblos which are still inhabited seem to furnish
us with the key to the interpretation of those that we find deserted or
in ruins, whether in Arizona or in Guatemala.</p>

<p>Pueblo Hungo Pavie. Chaco Cañon N. M.</p>
</div>

<p>In the architecture of the pueblos one typical form is reproduced with
sundry variations in detail. <span class="sidenote">Typical structure of the pueblo.</span>
The typical form is that of a solid block
of buildings making three sides of an extensive rectangular enclosure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> or courtyard. On the inside, facing upon the courtyard, the
structure is but one story in height; on the outside, looking out upon
the surrounding country, it rises to three, or perhaps even five or six
stories. From inside to outside the flat roofs rise in a series of
terraces, so that the floor of the second row is continuous with the
roof of the first, the floor of the third row is continuous with the
roof of the second, and so on. The fourth side of the rectangle is
formed by a solid block of one-story apartments, usually with one or two
narrow gateways overlooked by higher structures within the enclosure.
Except these gateways there is no entrance from without; the only
windows are frowning loop-holes, and access to the several apartments is
gained through skylights reached by portable ladders. Such a structure
is what our own forefathers would have naturally called a "burgh," or
fortress; it is in one sense a house, yet in another sense a town;<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90" title="Go to footnote 90"><span class="small">[90]</span></a>
its divisions are not so much houses as compartments; it is a
joint-tenement affair, like the Iroquois long houses, but in a higher
stage of development.</p>

<p>Restoration of Pueblo Hungo Pavie.</p>
</div>

<p>So far as they have been studied, the pueblo Indians are found to be
organized in clans, with descent in the female line, as in the case of
the ruder Indians above described. In the event of marriage the young
husband goes to live with his wife, and she may turn him out of doors if
he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> deserves it.<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91" title="Go to footnote 91"><span class="small">[91]</span></a>
The ideas of property seem still limited
to that of possessory right,
<span class="sidenote">Pueblo society.</span>
with the ultimate title in the clan, except
that portable articles subject to individual ownership have become more
numerous. In government the council of sachems reappears with a
principal sachem, or cacique, called by the Spaniards "gobernador."
There is an organized priesthood, with distinct orders, and a ceremonial
more elaborate than those of the ruder Indians. In every pueblo there is
to be found at least one "estufa," or council-house, for governmental or
religious transactions. Usually there are two or three or more such
estufas. In mythology, in what we may call pictography or rudimentary
hieroglyphics, as well as in ordinary handicrafts, there is a marked
advance beyond the Indians of the lower status of barbarism, after
making due allowances for such things as the people of the pueblos have
learned from white men.<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92" title="Go to footnote 92"><span class="small">[92]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>From the pueblos still existing, whether inhabited or in ruins, we may
eventually get some sort of clue to the populations of ancient towns
visited by the Spanish <span class="sidenote">Wonderful ancient pueblos in the Chaco valley.</span>
discoverers.<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93" title="Go to footnote 93"><span class="small">[93]</span></a> The pueblo of Zuñi seems to have
had at one time a population of 5,000, but it has dwindled to less than
2,000. Of the ruined pueblos, built of stone with adobe mortar, in the
valley of the Rio Chaco, the Pueblo Hungo Pavie contained 73 apartments
in the first story, 53 in the second, and 29 in the third, with an
average size of 18 feet by 13; and would have accommodated about 1,000
Indians. In the same valley Pueblo Bonito, with four stories, contained
not less than 640 apartments, with room enough for a population of
3,000; within a third of a mile from this huge structure stood Pueblo
Chettro Kettle, with 506 apartments. The most common variation from the
rectangular shape was that in which a terraced semicircle was
substituted for the three terraced sides, as in Pueblo Bonito, or the
whole rectangular design was converted into an ellipse, as in Pueblo
Peñasca Blanca. There are indications that these fortresses were not in
all cases built at one time, but that, at least in some cases, they grew
by gradual accretions.<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94" title="Go to footnote 94"><span class="small">[94]</span></a> The smallness of the distances between those
in the Chaco valley suggests that their inhabitants must have been
united in a confederation; and one can easily see that an actual
juxtaposition or partial coalescence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span> of such communities would
have made a city of very imposing appearance. The pueblos are always
found situated near a river, and their gardens, lying outside, are
easily accessible to sluices <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> from neighbouring cliffs or
mesas. <span class="sidenote">The Moqui pueblos.</span>
But in some cases, as the Wolpi pueblo of the Moquis, the whole
stronghold is built upon the summit of the cliff; there is a coalescence
of communal structures, each enclosing a courtyard, in which there is a
spring for the water-supply; and the irrigated gardens are built in
terrace-form just below on the bluff, and protected by solid walls. From
this curious pueblo another transition takes us to the extraordinary
cliff-houses found in the Chelly, Mancos, and McElmo cañons, and
elsewhere,&mdash;veritable <span class="sidenote">The cliff pueblos.</span>
human eyries perched in crevices or clefts of the
perpendicular rock, accessible only by dint of a toilsome and perilous
climb; places of refuge, perhaps for fragments of tribes overwhelmed by
more barbarous invaders, yet showing in their dwelling-rooms and estufas
marks of careful building and tasteful adornment.<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95" title="Go to footnote 95"><span class="small">[95]</span></a></p>

<p>The pueblo of Zuñi is a more extensive and complex structure than the
ruined pueblos on the Chaco river. It is not so much an enormous
communal house as a small town formed of a number of such houses crowded
together, with access from one to another along their roof-terraces.
<span class="sidenote">Pueblo of Zuñi.</span>
Some of the structures are of adobe brick, others of stone embedded in
adobe mortar <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> and covered with plaster. There are two open
plazas or squares in the town, and several streets, some of which are
covered ways passing beneath the upper stories of houses. The effect,
though not splendid, must be very picturesque, and would doubtless
astonish and bewilder visitors unprepared for such a sight. When
Coronado's men discovered Zuñi in 1540, although that style of building
was no longer a novelty to them, they compared the place to Granada.</p>

<p>Now it is worthy of note that Cortes made the same comparison in the
case of Tlascala, one of the famous towns at which he stopped on his
march from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico. In his letter to the emperor
Charles V.,
<span class="sidenote">Pueblo of Tlascala.</span>
he compared Tlascala to Granada, "affirming that it was
larger, stronger, and more populous than the Moorish capital at the time
of the conquest, and quite as well built."<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96" title="Go to footnote 96"><span class="small">[96]</span></a> Upon this Mr. Prescott
observes, "we shall be slow to believe that its edifices could have
rivalled those monuments of Oriental magnificence, whose light aerial
forms still survive after the lapse of ages, the admiration of every
traveller of sensibility and taste. The truth is that Cortes, like
Columbus, saw objects through the warm medium of his own fond
imagination, giving them a higher tone of colouring and larger
dimensions than were strictly warranted by the fact." Or, as Mr.
Bandelier puts <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> it, when it comes to general statements about
numbers and dimensions, "the descriptions of the conquerors cannot be
taken as facts, only as the expression of feelings, honestly entertained
but uncritical." From details given in various Spanish descriptions,
including those of Cortes himself, it is evident that there could not
have been much difference in size between Tlascala and its neighbour
Cholula. The population of the latter town has often been given as from
150,000 to 200,000; but, from elaborate archæological investigations
made on the spot in 1881, Mr. Bandelier concludes that it cannot have
greatly exceeded 30,000, and this number really agrees with the
estimates of two very important Spanish authorities, Las Casas and
Torquemada, when correctly understood.<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97" title="Go to footnote 97"><span class="small">[97]</span></a> We may therefore suppose that
the population of Tlascala was about 30,000. Now the population of the
city of Granada, at the time of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> its conquest by Ferdinand and
Isabella, is said by the greatest of Spanish historians<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98" title="Go to footnote 98"><span class="small">[98]</span></a> to have been
about 200,000. It would thus appear that Cortes sometimes let his
feelings run away with him; and, all things considered, small blame to
him if he did! In studying the story of the Spanish conquest of America,
liberal allowance must often be made for inaccuracies of statement that
were usually pardonable and sometimes inevitable.</p>

<p>But when Cortes described Tlascala as "quite as well built" as Granada,
it is not at all likely that he was thinking about that exquisite
Moorish architecture which in the mind of Mr. Prescott or any cultivated
modern writer is the first thing to be suggested by the name. The
Spaniards of those days did not admire the artistic work of "infidels;"
they covered up beautiful arabesques with a wash of dirty plaster, and
otherwise behaved very much like the Puritans who smashed the
"idolatrous" statues in English cathedrals. When Cortes looked at
Tlascala, and Coronado looked at Zuñi, and both soldiers were reminded
of Granada, they were probably looking at those places with a
professional eye as fortresses hard to capture; and from this point of
view there was doubtless some justice in the comparison.</p>

<p>In the description of Tlascala by the Spaniards who first saw it, with
its dark and narrow streets, its houses of adobe, or "the better sort"
of stone laid in adobe mortar, and its flat and terraced roofs, one is
irresistibly reminded of such a pueblo <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> as Zuñi. Tlascala was a
town of a type probably common in Mexico.
<span class="sidenote">The ancient city of Mexico was a great composite pueblo.</span>
In some respects, as will
hereafter appear, the city of Mexico showed striking variations from the
common type. Yet there too were to be seen the huge houses, with
terraced roofs, built around a square courtyard; in one of them 450
Spaniards, with more than 1,000 Tlascalan allies, were accommodated; in
another, called "Montezuma's palace," one of the conquerors, who came
several times intending to see the whole of it, got so tired with
wandering through the interminable succession of rooms that at length he
gave it up and never saw them all.<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99" title="Go to footnote 99"><span class="small">[99]</span></a> This might have happened in such
a building as Pueblo Bonito; and a suspicion is raised that Montezuma's
city was really a vast composite pueblo, and that its so-called palaces
were communal buildings in principle like the pueblos of the Chaco
valley.</p>

<p>Of course the Spanish discoverers could not be expected to understand
the meaning of what they saw.
<span class="sidenote">Natural mistake of the Spanish discoverers.</span>
It dazed and bewildered them. They knew
little or nothing of any other kind of society than feudal monarchy, and
if they made such mistakes as to call the head war-chief a "king" (i. e.
feudal king) or "emperor," and the clan-chiefs "lords" or "noblemen," if
they supposed that these huge fortresses <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> were like feudal
castles and palaces in Europe, they were quite excusable. Such
misconceptions were common enough before barbarous societies had been
much studied; and many a dusky warrior, without a tithe of the pomp and
splendour about him that surrounded Montezuma, has figured in the pages
of history as a mighty potentate girt with many of the trappings of
feudalism.<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100" title="Go to footnote 100"><span class="small">[100]</span></a> Initial misconceptions that were natural enough, indeed
unavoidable, found expression in an absurdly inappropriate nomenclature;
and then the use of wrong names and titles bore fruit in what one cannot
properly call a theory but rather an incoherent medley of notions about
barbaric society. Nothing could be further from <i>feudalism</i>, in which
the relation of landlord and tenant is a fundamental element, than the
society of the American aborigines, in which that relation was utterly
unknown and inconceivable. <span class="sidenote">Contrast between feudalism and gentilism.</span>
This more primitive form of society is not
improperly called <i>gentilism</i>, inasmuch as it is based upon the gens or
clan, with communism in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span> living, and with the conception of
individual ownership of property undeveloped. It was gentilism that
everywhere prevailed throughout the myriads of unrecorded centuries
during which the foremost races of mankind struggled up through savagery
and barbarism into civilization, while weaker and duller races lagged
behind at various stages on the way.
<span class="sidenote">Change from gentile society to political society.</span>
The change from "gentile" society
to political society as we know it was in some respects the most
important change that has occurred in human affairs since men became
human. It might be roughly defined as the change from personal to
territorial organization. It was accomplished when the stationary clan
became converted into the township, and the stationary tribe into the
small state;<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101" title="Go to footnote 101"><span class="small">[101]</span></a> when the conception of individual property in land was
fully acquired; when the tie of physical kinship ceased to be
indispensable as a bond for holding a society together; when the
<i>clansman</i> became a <i>citizen</i>. This momentous change was accomplished
among the Greeks during a period beginning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> shortly before the
first Olympiad (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 776), and ending with the reforms of Kleisthenes
at Athens (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 509); among the Romans it was accomplished by the
series of legislative changes beginning with those ascribed to Servius
Tullius (about <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 550), and perfected by the time of the first Punic
War (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 264-241). In each case about three centuries was required to
work the change.<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102" title="Go to footnote 102"><span class="small">[102]</span></a> If now the reader, familiar with European history,
will reflect upon the period of more than a thousand years which
intervened between the date last named and the time when feudalism
became thoroughly established, if he will recall to mind the vast and
powerful complication of causes which operated to transform civil
society from the aspect which it wore in the days of Regulus and the
second Ptolemy to that which it had assumed in the times of Henry the
Fowler or Fulk of Anjou, he will begin to realize how much "feudalism"
implies, and what a wealth of experience it involves, above and beyond
the change from "gentile" to "civil" society. It does not appear that
any people in ancient America ever approached very near to this earlier
change. None had fairly begun to emerge from gentilism; none had
advanced so far as the Greeks of the first Olympiad or the Romans under
the rule of the Tarquins.</p>

<p>The first eminent writer to express a serious <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> doubt as to the
correctness of the earlier views of Mexican civilization was that
sagacious Scotchman, <span class="sidenote">Suspicions as to the erroneousness of the Spanish accounts.</span>
William Robertson.<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103" title="Go to footnote 103"><span class="small">[103]</span></a> The illustrious statesman
and philologist, Albert Gallatin, founder of the American Ethnological
Society, published in the first volume of its "Transactions" an essay
which recognized the danger of trusting the Spanish narratives without
very careful and critical scrutiny.<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href="#footnote104" title="Go to footnote 104"><span class="small">[104]</span></a> It is to be observed that Mr.
Gallatin approached the subject with somewhat more knowledge of
aboriginal life in America than had been possessed by previous writers.
A similar scepticism was expressed by Lewis Cass, who also knew a great
deal about Indians.<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105" title="Go to footnote 105"><span class="small">[105]</span></a> Next came Mr. Morgan,<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106" title="Go to footnote 106"><span class="small">[106]</span></a> the man of
path-breaking ideas, whose minute and profound acquaintance with Indian
life was joined with a power of penetrating the hidden implications of
facts so keen and so sure as to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> amount to genius. Mr. Morgan
saw the nature of the delusion under which the Spaniards laboured;
<span class="sidenote">Detection and explanation of the errors, by Lewis Morgan.</span>
he
saw that what they mistook for feudal castles owned by great lords, and
inhabited by dependent retainers, were really huge communal houses,
owned and inhabited by clans, or rather by segments of overgrown clans.
He saw this so vividly that it betrayed him now and then into a somewhat
impatient and dogmatic manner of statement; but that was a slight fault,
for what he saw was not the outcome of dreamy speculation but of
scientific insight. His researches, which reduced "Montezuma's empire"
to a confederacy of tribes dwelling in pueblos, governed by a council of
chiefs, and collecting tribute from neighbouring pueblos, have been
fully sustained by subsequent investigation.</p>

<p>The state of society which Cortes saw has, indeed, passed away, and its
monuments and hieroglyphic records have been in great part destroyed.
Nevertheless some monuments and some hieroglyphic records remain, and
the people are still there. Tlascalans and Aztecs, descendants in the
eleventh or twelfth generation from the men whose bitter feuds gave such
a golden opportunity to Cortes, still dwell upon the soil of Mexico, and
speak the language in which Montezuma made his last harangue to the
furious people. There is, moreover, a great mass of literature in
Spanish, besides more or less in Nahuatl, written during the century
following the conquest, and the devoted missionaries and painstaking
administrators, who wrote books about the country in which they were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> working, were not engaged in a wholesale conspiracy for
deceiving mankind. From a really critical study of this literature,
combined with archæological investigation, much may be expected; and a
noble beginning has already been made. A more extensive acquaintance
with Mexican literature would at times have materially modified Mr.
Morgan's conclusions, though without altering their general drift. At
this point the work has been taken up by
<span class="sidenote">Adolf Bandelier's researches.</span>
Mr. Adolf Bandelier, of
Highland, Illinois, to whose rare sagacity and untiring industry as a
field archæologist is joined such a thorough knowledge of Mexican
literature as few men before him have possessed. Armed with such
resources, Mr. Bandelier is doing for the ancient history of America
work as significant as that which Mommsen has done for Rome, or Baur for
the beginnings of Christianity. When a sufficient mass of facts and
incidents have once been put upon record, it is hard for ignorant
misconception to bury the truth in a pit so deep but that the delving
genius of critical scholarship will sooner or later drag it forth into
the light of day.<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107" title="Go to footnote 107"><span class="small">[107]</span></a></p>

<p>At this point in our exposition a very concise summary of Mr.
Bandelier's results will suffice to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> enable the reader to
understand their import. What has been called the "empire of Montezuma"
was in reality a confederacy of three tribes, the Aztecs, Tezcucans, and
Tlacopans,<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108" title="Go to footnote 108"><span class="small">[108]</span></a> dwelling in three large composite pueblos situated very
near together in one of the strongest defensive positions ever occupied
by Indians. <span class="sidenote">The Aztec confederacy.</span>
This Aztec confederacy extended its "sway" over a
considerable portion of the Mexican peninsula, but that "sway" could not
correctly be described as "empire," for it was in no sense a military
occupation of the country. The confederacy did not have garrisons in
subject pueblos or civil officials to administer their affairs for them.
It simply sent some of its chiefs about from one pueblo to another to
collect tribute. This tax consisted in great part of maize and other
food, and each tributary pueblo reserved a certain portion of its tribal
territory to be cultivated for the benefit of the domineering
confederacy. If a pueblo proved delinquent or recalcitrant, Aztec
warriors swooped down upon it in stealthy midnight assault, butchered
its inhabitants and emptied its granaries, and when the paroxysm of rage
had spent itself, went exulting homeward, carrying away women for
concubines, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> men to be sacrificed, and such miscellaneous booty
as could be conveyed without wagons or beasts to draw them.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109" title="Go to footnote 109"><span class="small">[109]</span></a> If the
sudden assault, with scaling ladders, happened to fail, the assailants
were likely to be baffled, for there was no artillery, and so little
food could be carried that a siege meant starvation for the besiegers.</p>

<p>The tributary pueblos were also liable to be summoned to furnish a
contingent of warriors to the war-parties of the confederacy, under the
same penalties for delinquency as in the case of refusal of tribute. In
such cases it was quite common for the confederacy to issue a peremptory
summons, followed by a declaration of war. When a pueblo was captured,
the only way in which the vanquished people could stop the massacre was
by holding out signals of submission; a parley then sometimes adjusted
the affair, and the payment of a year's tribute in advance induced the
conquerors to depart, but captives once taken could seldom if ever be
ransomed. If the parties could not agree upon terms, the slaughter was
renewed, and sometimes went on until the departing victors left nought
behind them but ruined houses belching from loop-hole and doorway lurid
clouds of smoke and flame upon narrow silent streets heaped up with
mangled corpses.</p>

<p>The sway of the Aztec confederacy over the Mexican peninsula was thus
essentially similar to the sway of the Iroquois confederacy over a great
part of the tribes between the Connecticut river <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> and the
Mississippi. It was simply the levying of tribute,&mdash;a system of plunder
enforced by terror. The so-called empire was "only a partnership formed
for the purpose of carrying on the business of warfare, and that
intended, not for the extension of territorial ownership, but only for
an increase of the means of subsistence."<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110" title="Go to footnote 110"><span class="small">[110]</span></a> There was none of that
coalescence and incorporation of peoples which occurs after the change
from gentilism to civil society has been effected. Among the Mexicans,
as elsewhere throughout North America, the tribe remained intact as the
highest completed political integer.</p>

<p>The Aztec tribe was organized in clans and phratries,
<span class="sidenote">Aztec clans.</span>
and the number of
clans would indicate that the tribe was a very large one.<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111" title="Go to footnote 111"><span class="small">[111]</span></a> There
were twenty clans, called in the Nahuatl language "calpullis." We may
fairly suppose that the average size of a clan was larger <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span> than
the average tribe of Algonquins or Iroquois; but owing to the compact
"city" life, this increase of numbers did not result in segmentation and
scattering, as among Indians in the lower status. Each Aztec clan seems
to have occupied a number of adjacent communal houses, forming a kind of
precinct, with its special house or houses for official purposes,
corresponding to the <i>estufas</i> in the New Mexican pueblos. The houses
were the common property of the clan, and so was the land which its
members cultivated; and such houses and land could not be sold or
bartered away by the clan, or in anywise alienated. The idea of "real
estate" had not been developed; the clan simply exercised a right of
occupancy, and&mdash;as among some ruder Indians&mdash;its individual members
exercised certain limited rights of user in particular garden-plots.</p>

<p>The clan was governed by a clan council, consisting of chiefs
(<i>tecuhtli</i>) elected by the clan, and inducted into office after a cruel
religious ordeal, in which the candidate was bruised, tortured, and half
starved. <span class="sidenote">Clan officers.</span>
An executive department was more clearly differentiated from
the council than among the Indians of the lower status. The clan
(<i>calpulli</i>) had an official head, or sachem, called the <i>calpullec</i>;
and also a military commander called the <i>ahcacautin</i>, or "elder
brother." The <i>ahcacautin</i> was also a kind of peace officer, or
constable, for the precinct occupied by the clan, and carried about with
him a staff of office; a tuft of white feathers attached to this staff
betokened that his errand was one of death. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> The clan elected
its <i>calpullec</i> and <i>ahcacautin</i>, and could depose them for cause.<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112" title="Go to footnote 112"><span class="small">[112]</span></a></p>

<p>The members of the clan were reciprocally bound to aid, defend, and
avenge one another; but wergild was no longer accepted, and the penalty
for murder was death. The clan exercised the right of naming its
members. Such names were invariably significant (as <i>Nezahualcoyotl</i>,
"Hungry Coyote," <i>Axayacatl</i>, "Face-in-the-Water," etc.),
<span class="sidenote">Rights and duties of the clan.</span>
and more or
less "medicine," or superstitious association, was attached to the name.
The clans also had their significant names and totems. Each clan had its
peculiar religious rites, its priests or medicine-men who were members
of the clan council, and its temple or medicine-house. Instead of
burying their dead the Mexican tribes practised cremation; there was,
therefore, no common cemetery, but the funeral ceremonies were conducted
by the clan.</p>

<p>The clans of the Aztecs, like those of many other Mexican tribes, were
organized into four phratries; and this divided the city of Mexico,
<span class="sidenote">Aztec phratries.</span>
as
the Spaniards at once remarked, into four quarters. The phratry had
acquired more functions than it possessed in the lower status. Besides
certain religious and social duties, and besides its connection with the
punishment of criminals, the Mexican phratry was an organization for
military purposes.<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113" title="Go to footnote 113"><span class="small">[113]</span></a> The four <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span> phratries were four divisions
of the tribal host, each with its captain. In each of the quarters was
an arsenal, or "dart-house," where weapons were stored, and from which
they were handed out to war-parties about to start on an expedition.</p>

<p>The supreme government of the Aztecs was vested in the tribal council
composed of twenty members, <span class="sidenote">The tribal council.</span>
one for each clan. The member, representing
a clan, was not its <i>calpullec</i>, or "sachem;" he was one of the
<i>tecuhtli</i>, or clan-chiefs, and was significantly called the "speaker"
(<i>tlatoani</i>). The tribal council, thus composed of twenty speakers, was
called the <i>tlatocan</i>, or "place of speech."<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114" title="Go to footnote 114"><span class="small">[114]</span></a> At least as often as
once in ten days the council assembled at the <i>tecpan</i>, or official
house of the tribe, but it could be convened whenever occasion required,
and in cases of emergency was continually in session. Its powers and
duties were similar to those of an ancient English shiremote, in so far
as they were partly directive and partly judicial. A large part of its
business was settling disputes between the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> clans. It
superintended the ceremonies of investiture with which the chiefs and
other officers of the clans were sworn into office. At intervals of
eighty days there was an "extra session" of the <i>tlatocan</i>, attended
also by the twenty "elder brothers," the four phratry-captains, the two
executive chiefs of the tribe, and the leading priests, and at such
times a reconsideration of an unpopular decision might be urged; but the
authority of the <i>tlatocan</i> was supreme, and from its final decision
there could be no appeal.<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115" title="Go to footnote 115"><span class="small">[115]</span></a></p>

<p>The executive chiefs of the tribe were two in number, as was commonly
the case in ancient America. The tribal sachem, or civil executive, bore
the grotesque title of <i>cihuacoatl</i>,<span class="sidenote">The "snake-woman."</span>
or "snake-woman."<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116" title="Go to footnote 116"><span class="small">[116]</span></a> His relation
to the tribe was in general like that of the <i>calpullec</i> to the clan. He
executed the decrees of the tribal council, of which he was <i>ex officio</i>
a member, and was responsible for the housing of tribute and its proper
distribution among the clans. He was also chief judge, and he was
lieutenant to the head war-chief in command of the tribal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span>
host.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117" title="Go to footnote 117"><span class="small">[117]</span></a> He was elected for life by the tribal council, which could
depose him for misconduct.</p>

<p>The office of head war-chief was an instance of primitive royalty in a
very interesting stage of development. The title of this officer was
<i>tlacatecuhtli</i>,<span class="sidenote">The "chief-of men."</span>
or "chief-of-men."<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118" title="Go to footnote 118"><span class="small">[118]</span></a> He was primarily head war-chief
of the Aztec tribe, but about 1430 became supreme military commander of
the three confederate tribes, so that his office was one of peculiar
dignity and importance. When the Spaniards arrived upon the scene
Montezuma was <i>tlacatecuhtli</i>, and they naturally called him "king." To
understand precisely how far such an epithet could correctly be applied
to him, and how far it was misleading, we must recall the manner in
which early kingship arose in Europe. The Roman <i>rex</i> was an officer
elected for life; the typical Greek <i>basileus</i> was a somewhat more fully
developed king, inasmuch as his office was becoming practically
hereditary; <span class="sidenote">Evolution of kingship in Greece and Rome.</span>
otherwise <i>rex</i> was about equivalent to <i>basileus</i>. Alike in
Rome and in Greece the king had at least three great functions, and
possibly four.<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119" title="Go to footnote 119"><span class="small">[119]</span></a> He was, primarily, chief <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> commander,
secondly, chief priest, thirdly, chief judge; whether he had reached the
fourth stage and added the functions of chief civil executive, is matter
of dispute. Kingship in Rome and in most Greek cities was overthrown at
so early a date that some questions of this sort are difficult to
settle. But in all probability the office grew up through the successive
acquisition of ritual, judicial, and civil functions by the military
commander. The paramount necessity of consulting the tutelar deities
before fighting resulted in making the general a priest competent to
perform sacrifices and interpret omens;<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120" title="Go to footnote 120"><span class="small">[120]</span></a> he thus naturally became
the most important among priests; an increased sanctity invested his
person and office; and by and by he acquired control over the
dispensation of justice, and finally over the whole civil
administration. One step more was needed to develop the <i>basileus</i> into
a despot, like the king of Persia, and that was to let him get into his
hands the law-making power, involving complete control over taxation.
When the Greeks and Romans became dissatisfied with the increasing
powers of their kings, they destroyed the office. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> Romans
did not materially diminish its functions, but put them into commission,
by entrusting them to two consuls of equal authority elected annually.
The Greeks, on the other hand, divided the royal functions among
different officers, as e. g. at Athens among the nine archons.<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121" title="Go to footnote 121"><span class="small">[121]</span></a></p>

<p>The typical kingship in mediæval Europe, after the full development of
the feudal system, was very different indeed from the kingship in early
Greece and Rome. <span class="sidenote">Mediæval kingship.</span>
In the Middle Ages all priestly functions had passed
into the hands of the Church.<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122" title="Go to footnote 122"><span class="small">[122]</span></a> A king like Charles VII. of France,
or Edward III. of England, was military commander, civil magistrate,
chief judge, and <i>supreme landlord</i>; the people were his tenants. That
was the kind of king with which the Spanish discoverers of Mexico were
familiar.</p>

<p>Now the Mexican <i>tlacatecuhtli</i>, or "chief-of-men," was much more like
Agamemnon in point of kingship than like Edward III. He was not supreme
landlord, for landlordship did not exist in Mexico. He was not chief
judge or civil magistrate; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> those functions belonged to the
"snake-woman." Mr. Bandelier regards the "chief-of-men" as simply a
military commander; <span class="sidenote">Montezuma was a "priest-commander."</span>
but for reasons which I shall state hereafter,<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123" title="Go to footnote 123"><span class="small">[123]</span></a>
it seems quite clear that he exercised certain very important priestly
functions, although beside him there was a kind of high-priest or
medicine-chief. If I am right in holding that Montezuma was a
"priest-commander," then incipient royalty in Mexico had advanced at
least one stage beyond the head war-chief of the Iroquois, and remained
one stage behind the <i>basileus</i> of the Homeric Greeks.</p>

<p>The <i>tlacatecuhtli</i>, or "chief-of-men," was elected by an assembly
consisting of the tribal council, the "elder brothers" of the several
clans, and certain leading priests. <span class="sidenote">Mode of succession to the office.</span>
Though the office was thus elective,
the choice seems to have been practically limited to a particular clan,
and in the eleven chiefs who were chosen from 1375 to 1520 a certain
principle or custom of succession seems to be plainly indicated.<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124" title="Go to footnote 124"><span class="small">[124]</span></a>
There was a further limit to the order of succession. Allusion has been
made to the four phratry-captains commanding the quarters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span> city. Their cheerful titles were "man of the house of darts,"
"cutter of men," "bloodshedder," and "chief of the eagle and cactus."
These captains were military chiefs of the phratries, and also
magistrates charged with the duty of maintaining order and enforcing the
decrees of the council in their respective quarters. The "chief of the
eagle and cactus" was chief executioner,&mdash;Jack Ketch. He was not
eligible for the office of "chief-of-men;" the three other
phratry-captains were eligible. Then there was a member of the
priesthood entitled "man of the dark house." This person, with the three
eligible captains, made a quartette, and one of this privileged four
<i>must</i> succeed to the office of "chief-of-men."</p>

<p>The eligibility of the "man of the dark house" may be cited here as
positive proof that sometimes the "chief-of-men" could be a
"priest-commander." That in all cases he acquired priestly functions
after election, even when he did not possess them before, is indicated
by the fact that at the ceremony of his induction into office he
ascended to the summit of the pyramid sacred to the war-god
Huitzilopochtli, where he was anointed by the high-priest with a black
ointment, and sprinkled with sanctified water; having thus become
consecrated he took a censer of live coals and a bag of copal, and as
his first official act offered incense to the war-god.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125" title="Go to footnote 125"><span class="small">[125]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>

<p>As the "chief-of-men" was elected, so too he could be deposed for
misbehaviour. He was <i>ex officio</i> a member of the tribal council, and he
had his official residence in the <i>tecpan</i>, or tribal house, where the
meetings of the council were held, and where the hospitalities of the
tribe were extended to strangers. As an administrative officer, the
"chief-of-men" had little to do within the limits of the tribe; that, as
already observed, was the business of the "snake-woman." But outside of
the confederacy the "chief-of-men" exercised administrative functions.
He superintended the collection of tribute.
<span class="sidenote">Manner of collecting tribute.</span>
Each of the three
confederate tribes appointed, through its tribal council, agents to
visit the subjected pueblos and gather in the tribute. These agents were
expressively termed <i>calpixqui</i>, "crop-gatherers." As these men were
obliged to spend considerable time in the vanquished pueblos in the
double character of tax-collectors and spies, we can imagine how hateful
their position was. Their security from injury depended upon the
reputation of their tribes for ruthless ferocity.<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126" title="Go to footnote 126"><span class="small">[126]</span></a> The tiger-like
confederacy was only too ready to take offence; in the lack of a decent
pretext it often went to war without one, simply in order to get human
victims for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Once appointed, the tax-gatherers were directed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> by the
"chief-of-men." The tribute was chiefly maize, but might be anything the
conquerors chose to demand,&mdash;weapons, fine pottery or featherwork, gold
ornaments, or female slaves. Sometimes the tributary pueblo, instead of
sacrificing all its prisoners of war upon its own altars, sent some of
them up to Mexico as part of its tribute. The ravening maw of the
horrible deities was thus appeased, not by the pueblo that paid the
blackmail, but by the power that extorted it, and thus the latter
obtained a larger share of divine favour. Generally the unhappy
prisoners were forced to carry the corn and other articles. They were
convoyed by couriers who saw that everything was properly delivered at
the <i>tecpan</i>, and also brought information by word of mouth and by
picture-writing from the <i>calpixqui</i> to the "chief-of-men." When the
newly-arrived Spaniards saw these couriers coming and going they fancied
that they were "ambassadors." This system of tribute-taking made it
necessary to build roads, and this in turn facilitated, not only
military operations, but trade, which had already made some progress
albeit of a simple sort. These "roads" might perhaps more properly be
called Indian trails,<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127" title="Go to footnote 127"><span class="small">[127]</span></a> but they served their purpose.</p>

<p>The general similarity of the Aztec confederacy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> to that of the
Iroquois, in point of social structure, is thus clearly manifest.
<span class="sidenote">Aztec and Iroquois confederacies contrasted.</span>
Along
with this general similarity we have observed some points of higher
development, such as one might expect to find in traversing the entire
length of an ethnical period. Instead of stockaded villages, with houses
of bark or of clay supported upon a wooden framework, we have pueblos of
adobe-brick or stone, in various stages of evolution, the most advanced
of which present the appearance of castellated cities. Along with the
systematic irrigation and increased dependence upon horticulture, we
find evidences of greater density of population; and we see in the
victorious confederacy a more highly developed organization for adding
to its stock of food and other desirable possessions by the systematic
plunder of neighbouring weaker communities. Naturally such increase in
numbers and organization entails some increase in the number of officers
and some differentiation of their functions, as illustrated in the
representation of the clans (<i>calpulli</i>) in the tribal council
(<i>tlatocan</i>), by speakers (<i>tlatoani</i>) chosen for the purpose, and not
by the official heads (<i>calpullec</i>) of the clan. Likewise in the
military commander-in-chief (<i>tlacatecuhtli</i>) we observe a marked
increase in dignity, and&mdash;as I have already suggested and hope to
maintain&mdash;we find that his office has been clothed with sacerdotal
powers, and has thus taken a decided step toward kingship of the ancient
type, as depicted in the Homeric poems.</p>

<p>No feature of the advance is more noteworthy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span> than the
development of the medicine-men into an organized priesthood.<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128" title="Go to footnote 128"><span class="small">[128]</span></a> The
<span class="sidenote">Aztec priesthood: human sacrifices.</span>
presence of this priesthood and its ritual was proclaimed to the eyes of
the traveller in ancient Mexico by the numerous tall truncated pyramids
(<i>teocallis</i>), on the flat summits of which men, women, and children
were sacrificed to the gods. This custom of human sacrifice seems to
have been a characteristic of the middle period of barbarism, and to
have survived, with diminishing frequency, into the upper period. There
are abundant traces of its existence throughout the early Aryan world,
from Britain to Hindustan, as well as among the ancient Hebrews and
their kindred.<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129" title="Go to footnote 129"><span class="small">[129]</span></a> But among all these peoples, at the earliest times
at which we can study them with trustworthy records, we find the custom
of human sacrifice in an advanced stage of decline, and generally no
longer accompanied by the custom of cannibalism in which it probably
originated.<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130" title="Go to footnote 130"><span class="small">[130]</span></a> Among the Mexicans, however, when they were first
visited by the Spaniards, cannibalism flourished as nowhere else in the
world except perhaps in Fiji, and human sacrifices were conducted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> on such a scale as could not have been witnessed in Europe
without going back more than forty centuries.</p>

<p>The custom of sacrificing captives to the gods was a marked advance upon
the practice in the lower period of barbarism, when the prisoner, unless
saved by adoption into the tribe of his captors, was put to death with
lingering torments. There were occasions on which the Aztecs tortured
their prisoners before sending them to the altar,<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131" title="Go to footnote 131"><span class="small">[131]</span></a> but in general
the prisoner was well-treated and highly fed,&mdash;fatted, in short, for the
final banquet in which the worshippers participated with their savage
deity.<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a><a href="#footnote132" title="Go to footnote 132"><span class="small">[132]</span></a> In a more advanced stage of development than that which the
Aztecs had reached, in the stage when agriculture became extensive
enough to create a steady demand for servile labour, the practice of
enslaving prisoners became general; and as slaves became more and more
valuable, men gradually succeeded in compounding with their deities for
easier terms,&mdash;a ram, or a kid, or a bullock, instead of the human
victim.<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133" title="Go to footnote 133"><span class="small">[133]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span>

<p>The ancient Mexicans had not arrived at this stage, which in the Old
World characterized the upper period of barbarism. Slavery had, however,
made a beginning among the Aztecs. <span class="sidenote">Aztec slaves.</span>
The nucleus of the small
slave-population of Mexico consisted of <i>outcasts</i>, persons expelled
from the clan for some misdemeanour. The simplest case was that in which
a member of a clan failed for two years to cultivate his
garden-plot.<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134" title="Go to footnote 134"><span class="small">[134]</span></a> The delinquent member was deprived, not only of his
right of user, but of all his rights as a clansman, and the only way to
escape starvation was to work upon some other lot, either <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> in
his own or in some other clan, and be paid in such pittance from its
produce as the occupant might choose to give him. This was slavery in
embryo. The occupant did not own this outcast labourer, any more than he
owned his lot; he only possessed a limited right of user in both
labourer and lot. To a certain extent it was "adverse" or exclusive
possession. If the slave ran away or was obstinately lazy, he could be
made to wear a wooden collar and sold without his consent; if it proved
too troublesome to keep him, the collared slave could be handed over to
the priests for sacrifice.<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135" title="Go to footnote 135"><span class="small">[135]</span></a> In this class of outcasts and their
masters we have an interesting illustration of a rudimentary phase of
slavery and of private property.</p>

<p>At this point it is worthy of note that in the development of the family
the Aztecs had advanced considerably beyond the point attained by
Shawnees and Mohawks, and a little way toward the point attained in the
patriarchal family of the ancient Romans and Hebrews. In the Aztec clan
(which was exogamous<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136" title="Go to footnote 136"><span class="small">[136]</span></a>)
<span class="sidenote">The Aztec family.</span>
the change to descent in the male line seems
to have been accomplished before the time of the Discovery. Apparently
it had been recently accomplished. Names for designating family
relationships remained in that primitive stage in which no distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> is made between father and uncle, grandchildren and cousins.
The family was still too feebly established to count for much in the
structure of society, which still rested firmly upon the clan.<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137" title="Go to footnote 137"><span class="small">[137]</span></a>
Nevertheless the marriage bonds were drawn much tighter than among
Indians of the lower status, and penalties for incontinence were more
severe. The wife became her husband's property and was entitled to the
protection of his clan. All matrimonial arrangements were controlled by
the clan, and no member of it, male or female, was allowed to remain
unmarried, except for certain religious reasons. The penalty for
contumacy was expulsion from the clan, and the same penalty was
inflicted for such sexual irregularities as public opinion, still in
what we should call quite a primitive stage, condemned. Men and women
thus expelled went to swell the numbers of that small class of outcasts
already noted. With men the result, as we have seen, was a kind of
slavery; with women it was prostitution; and it is curious to see that
the same penalty, entailing such a result, was visited alike upon
unseemly frailty and upon refusal to marry. In either case the sin
consisted in rebellion against the clan's standards of proper or
permissible behaviour.</p>

<p>The inheritance in the male line, the beginnings of individual property
in slaves, the tightening of the marriage bond, accompanied by the
condemnation of sundry irregularities heretofore tolerated, are
phenomena which we might expect to find associated together. They are
germs of the upper <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> status of barbarism, as well as of the
earliest status of civilization more remotely to follow. The common
cause, of which they are the manifestations, is an increasing sense of
the value and importance of personal property.
<span class="sidenote">Aztec property.</span>
In the Old World this
sense grew up during a pastoral stage of society such as the New World
never knew, and by the ages of Abraham and Agamemnon<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138" title="Go to footnote 138"><span class="small">[138]</span></a> it had
produced results such as had not been reached in Mexico at the time of
the Discovery. Still the tendency in the latter country was in a similar
direction. Though there was no notion of real estate, and the house was
still clan-property, yet the number and value of articles of personal
ownership had no doubt greatly increased during the long interval which
must have elapsed since the ancestral Mexicans entered upon the middle
status. The mere existence of large and busy market-places with regular
and frequent fairs, even though trade had scarcely begun to emerge from
the stage of barter, is sufficient proof of this. Such fairs and markets
do not belong to the Mohawk chapter in human progress. They imply a
considerable number and diversity of artificial products, valued as
articles of personal property. A legitimate inference from them is the
existence of a certain degree of luxury, though doubtless luxury of a
barbaric type.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span>

<p>It is at this point, I think, that a judicious critic will begin to part
company with Mr. Morgan. As regards the outward aspect of the society
which the Spaniards found in Mexico, <span class="sidenote">Mr. Morgan's rules.</span>
that eminent scholar more than once
used arguments that were inconsistent with principles of criticism laid
down by himself. At the beginning of his chapter on the Aztec
confederacy Mr. Morgan proposed the following rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The histories of Spanish America may be trusted in whatever relates to
the acts of the Spaniards, and to the acts and personal characteristics
of the Indians; in whatever relates to their weapons, implements and
utensils, fabrics, food and raiment, and things of a similar character.</p>

<p>"But in whatever relates to Indian society and government, their social
relations and plan of life, they are nearly worthless, because they
learned nothing and knew nothing of either. We are at full liberty to
reject them in these respects and commence anew; using any facts they
may contain which harmonize with what is known of Indian society."<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139" title="Go to footnote 139"><span class="small">[139]</span></a></p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been better if the second of these rules had been
somewhat differently worded; for even with regard to the strange society
and government, the Spanish writers have recorded an immense number of
valuable facts, without which Mr. Bandelier's work would have been
impossible. It is not so much the <i>facts</i> as the <i>interpretations</i> of
the Spanish historians that are "nearly worthless," and even their
misinterpretations <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> are interesting and instructive when once
we rightly understand them. Sometimes they really help us toward the
truth.</p>

<p>The broad distinction, however, as stated in Mr. Morgan's pair of rules,
is well taken. In regard to such a strange form of society the Spanish
discoverers of Mexico could not help making mistakes, but in regard to
utensils and dress their senses were not likely to deceive them, and
their statements, according to Mr. Morgan, may be trusted.
<span class="sidenote">Mr. Morgan sometimes disregarded his own rules: "Montezuma's
Dinner."</span>
Very good.
But as soon as Mr. Morgan had occasion to write about the social life of
the Aztecs, he forgot his own rules and paid as little respect to the
senses of eye-witnesses as to their judgment. This was amusingly
illustrated in his famous essay on "Montezuma's Dinner."<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140" title="Go to footnote 140"><span class="small">[140]</span></a> When
Bernal Diaz describes Montezuma as sitting on a low chair at a table
covered with a white cloth, Mr. Morgan declares that it could not have
been so,&mdash;there were no chairs or tables! On second thought he will
admit that there may have been a wooden block hollowed out for a stool,
but in the matter of a table he is relentless. So when Cortes, in his
despatch to the emperor, speaks of the "wine-cellar" and of the presence
of "secretaries" at dinner, Mr. Morgan observes, "Since cursive writing
was unknown among the Aztecs, the presence of these secretaries is an
amusing feature in the account. The wine-cellar also is remarkable for
two reasons: firstly, because the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> level of the streets and
courts was but four feet above the level of the water, which made
cellars impossible; and, secondly, because the Aztecs had no knowledge
of wine. An acid beer (<i>pulque</i>), made by fermenting the juice of the
maguey, was a common beverage of the Aztecs; but it is hardly supposable
that even this was used at dinner."<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141" title="Go to footnote 141"><span class="small">[141]</span></a></p>

<p>To this I would reply that the fibre of that same useful plant from
which the Aztecs made their "beer" supplied them also with paper, upon
which they were in the habit of writing, not indeed in cursive
characters, but in hieroglyphics. This kind of writing, as well as any
other, accounts for the presence of secretaries, which seems to me, by
the way, a very probable and characteristic feature in the narrative.
From the moment the mysterious strangers landed, every movement of
theirs had been recorded in hieroglyphics, and there is no reason why
notes of what they said and did should not have been taken at dinner. As
for the place where the <i>pulque</i> was kept, it was a venial slip of the
pen to call it a "wine-cellar," even if it was not below the ground. The
language of Cortes does not imply that he visited the "cellar;" he saw a
crowd of Indians drinking the beverage, and supposing the great house he
was in to be Montezuma's, he expressed his sense of that person's
hospitality by saying that "his wine-cellar was open to all." And
really, is it not rather a captious criticism which in one breath chides
Cortes for calling the beverage "wine," and in the next breath goes on
to call it "beer"? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> The <i>pulque</i> was neither the one nor the
other; for want of any other name a German might have called it beer, a
Spaniard would be more likely to call it wine. And why is it "hardly
supposable" that <i>pulque</i> was used at dinner? Why should Mr. Morgan, who
never dined with Montezuma, know so much more about <i>such things</i> than
Cortes and Bernal Diaz, who did?<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a><a href="#footnote142" title="Go to footnote 142"><span class="small">[142]</span></a></p>

<p>The Spanish statements of facts are, of course, not to be accepted
uncritically. When we are told of cut slabs of porphyry inlaid in the
walls of a room,
<span class="sidenote">The reaction against uncritical and exaggerated statements.</span>
we have a right to inquire how so hard a stone could be
cut with flint or copper chisels,<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143" title="Go to footnote 143"><span class="small">[143]</span></a> and are ready to entertain the
suggestion that some other stone might easily have been mistaken for
porphyry. Such a critical inquiry is eminently profitable, and none the
less so when it brings us to the conclusion that the Aztecs did succeed
in cutting porphyry. Again, when we read about Indian armies of 200,000
men, pertinent questions arise as to the commissariat, and we are led to
reflect that there is nothing about which old soldiers spin such
unconscionable yarns as about the size <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> of the armies they have
thrashed. In a fairy tale, of course, such suggestions are impertinent;
things can go on anyhow. In real life it is different. The trouble with
most historians of the conquest of Mexico has been that they have made
it like a fairy tale, and the trouble with Mr. Morgan was that, in a
wholesome and much-needed spirit of reaction, he was too much inclined
to dismiss the whole story as such. He forgot the first of his pair of
rules, and applied the second to everything alike. He felt "at full
liberty to reject" the testimony of the discoverers as to what they saw
and tasted, and to "commence anew," reasoning from "what is known of
Indian society." And here Mr. Morgan's mind was so full of the kind of
Indian society which he knew more minutely and profoundly than any other
man, that he was apt to forget that there could be any other kind. He
overlooked his own distinction between the lower and middle periods of
barbarism in his attempt to ignore or minimize the points of difference
between Aztecs and Iroquois.<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144" title="Go to footnote 144"><span class="small">[144]</span></a> In this way he did injustice to his
own brilliant and useful classification of stages of culture, and in
particular to the middle period of barbarism, the significance of which
he was the first to detect, but failed to realize fully because his
attention had been so intensely concentrated upon the lower period.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span>

<p>In truth, the middle period of barbarism was one of the most important
periods in the career of the human race, and full of fascination to the
student, <span class="sidenote">Importance of the middle period of barbarism.</span>
as the unfading interest in ancient Mexico and the huge mass of
literature devoted to it show. It spanned the interval between such
society as that of Hiawatha and such as that of the Odyssey. One more
such interval (and, I suspect, a briefer one, because the use of iron
and the development of inheritable wealth would accelerate progress) led
to the age that could <i>write</i> the Odyssey, one of the most beautiful
productions of the human mind. If Mr. Morgan had always borne in mind
that, on his own classification, Montezuma must have been at least as
near to Agamemnon as to Powhatan, his attitude toward the Spanish
historians would have been less hostile. A Moqui pueblo stands near the
lower end of the middle period of barbarism; ancient Troy stood next the
upper end. Mr. Morgan found apt illustrations in the former; perhaps if
he had lived long enough to profit by the work of Schliemann and
Bandelier, he might have found equally apt ones in the latter. Mr.
Bandelier's researches certainly show that the ancient city of Mexico,
in point of social development, stood somewhere between the two.</p>

<p>How that city looked may best be described when we come to tell what its
first Spanish visitors saw. Let it suffice here to say that, upon a
reasonable estimate of their testimony, pleasure-gardens, menageries and
aviaries, fountains and baths, tessellated marble floors, finely wrought
pottery, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> exquisite featherwork, brilliant mats and tapestries,
silver goblets, dainty spices burning in golden censers, varieties of
highly seasoned dishes, dramatic performances, jugglers and acrobats,
ballad singers and dancing girls,&mdash;such things were to be seen in this
city of snake-worshipping cannibals. It simulated civilization as a
tree-fern simulates a tree.</p>

<p>In its general outlines the account here given of Aztec society and
government at the time of the Discovery will probably hold true of all
the semi-civilized communities of the Mexican peninsula and Central
America. The pueblos of Mexico were doubtless of various grades of size,
strength, and comfort, ranging from such structures as Zuñi up to the
city of Mexico. <span class="sidenote">Mexicans and Mayas.</span>
The cities of Chiapas, Yucatan, and Guatemala, whose
ruins, in those tropical forests, are so impressive, probably belong to
the same class. The Maya-Quiché tribes, who dwelt and still dwell in
this region, were different in stock-language from their neighbours of
Mexico; but there are strong reasons for believing that the two great
groups, Mexicans and Mayas, arose from the expansion and segmentation of
one common stock, and there is no doubt as to the very close similarity
between the two in government, religion, and social advancement. In some
points the Mayas were superior. They possessed a considerable
literature, written in highly developed hieroglyphic characters upon
maguey paper and upon deerskin parchment, so that from this point of
view they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> stood upon the threshold of civilization as strictly
defined.<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145" title="Go to footnote 145"><span class="small">[145]</span></a> But, like the Mexicans, they were ignorant <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span> of
iron, their society was organized upon the principle of gentilism, they
were cannibals and sacrificed men and women to idols, some of which were
identical with those of Mexico. The Mayas had no conception of property
in land; their buildings were great communal houses, like pueblos; in
some cases these so-called palaces, at first supposed to be scanty
remnants of vast cities, were themselves the entire "cities;" in other
cases <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> there were doubtless large composite pueblos fit to be
called cities.</p>

<p>These noble ruins have excited great and increasing interest since the
publication of Mr. Stephens's charming book just fifty years ago.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href="#footnote146" title="Go to footnote 146"><span class="small">[146]</span></a>
An air of profound mystery surrounded them, and many wild theories were
propounded to account for their existence.
<span class="sidenote">Ruined cities of Central America.</span>
They were at first accredited
with a fabulous antiquity, and in at least one instance this notion was
responsible for what must be called misrepresentation, if not
humbug.<a id="footnotetag147" name="footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147" title="Go to footnote 147"><span class="small">[147]</span></a> Having been placed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> by popular fancy at such a
remote age, they were naturally supposed to have been built, not by the
Mayas,&mdash;who still inhabit Yucatan and do not absolutely dazzle us with
their exalted civilization,&mdash;but by some wonderful people long since
vanished. Now as to this point the sculptured slabs of Uxmal and
Chichen-Itza tell their own story. They are covered with hieroglyphic
inscriptions, and these hieroglyphs are the same as those in which the
Dresden Codex and other Maya manuscripts still preserved are written;
though their decipherment is not yet complete, there is no sort of doubt
as to their being written in the Maya characters. Careful inspection,
moreover, shows that the buildings in which these inscriptions occur are
not so very ancient. Mr. Stephens, who was one of their earliest as well
as sanest explorers, believed them to be the work of the Mayas at a
comparatively recent period.<a id="footnotetag148" name="footnotetag148"></a><a href="#footnote148" title="Go to footnote 148"><span class="small">[148]</span></a> The notion of their antiquity was
perhaps suggested by the belief that certain colossal mahogany trees
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span> growing between and over the ruins at Palenque must be nearly
2,000 years old. But when M. de Charnay visited Palenque in 1859 he had
the eastern side of the "palace" cleared of its dense vegetation in
order to get a good photograph; and when he revisited the spot in 1881
he found a sturdy growth of young mahogany the age of which he knew did
not exceed twenty-two years. Instead of making a ring once a year, as in
our sluggish and temperate zone, these trees had made rings at the rate
of about one in a month; their trunks were already more than two feet in
diameter; judging from this rate of growth the biggest giant on the
place need not have been more than 200 years old, if as much.<a id="footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a><a href="#footnote149" title="Go to footnote 149"><span class="small">[149]</span></a></p>

<p>These edifices are not so durably constructed as those which in Europe
have stood for more than a thousand years. They do not indicate a high
civilization on the part of their builders.
<span class="sidenote">They are probably not older than the twelfth century.</span>
They do not, as Mr. Andrew
Lang says, "throw Mycenæ into the shade, and rival the remains of
Cambodia."<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a><a href="#footnote150" title="Go to footnote 150"><span class="small">[150]</span></a> In pictures they may seem to do so, but M. de Charnay,
after close and repeated examination of these buildings, assures us that
as structures they "cannot be compared with those at Cambodia, which
belong to nearly the same period, the twelfth century, and which,
notwithstanding their greater and more resisting proportions, are found
in the same dilapidated condition."<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a><a href="#footnote151" title="Go to footnote 151"><span class="small">[151]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> It seems to me that
if Mr. Lang had spoken of the Yucatan ruins as rivalling the remains of
Mycenæ, instead of "throwing them into the shade," he would have come
nearer the mark. The builders of Uxmal, like those of Mycenæ, did not
understand the principle of the arch, but were feeling their way toward
it.<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a><a href="#footnote152" title="Go to footnote 152"><span class="small">[152]</span></a> And here again we are brought back, as seems to happen whatever
road we follow, to the middle status of barbarism. The Yucatan
architecture shows the marks of its origin in the adobe and rubble-stone
work of the New Mexico pueblos. The inside of the wall "is a rude
mixture of friable mortar and small irregular stones," and under the
pelting tropical rains the dislocation of the outer facing is presently
effected. The large blocks, cut with flint chisels, are of a soft stone
that is soon damaged by weather; and the cornices and lintels are beams
of a very hard wood, yet not so hard but that insects bore into it. From
such considerations it is justly inferred that the highest probable
antiquity for most of the ruins in Yucatan or Central America is the
twelfth or thirteenth century of our era.<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a><a href="#footnote153" title="Go to footnote 153"><span class="small">[153]</span></a> Some, perhaps, may be no
older than the ancient city of Mexico, built <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1325.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span>

<p>But we are no longer restricted to purely archæological evidence. One of
the most impressive of all these ruined cities is Chichen-Itza, which is
regarded as older than Uxmal, but not so old as Izamal.
<span class="sidenote">Chronicle of Chicxulub.</span>
Now in recent
times sundry old Maya documents have been discovered in Yucatan, and
among them is a brief history of the Spanish conquest of that country,
written in the Roman character by a native chief, Nakuk Pech, about
1562. It has been edited, with an English translation, by that zealous
and indefatigable scholar, to whom American philology owes such a debt
of gratitude,&mdash;Dr. Daniel Brinton. This chronicle tells us several
things that we did not know before, and, among others, it refers most
explicitly to Chichen-Itza and Izamal as inhabited towns during the time
that the Spaniards were coming, from 1519 to 1542. If there could have
been any lingering doubt as to the correctness of the views of Stephens,
Morgan, and Charnay, this contemporaneous documentary testimony dispels
it once for all.<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a><a href="#footnote154" title="Go to footnote 154"><span class="small">[154]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span>

<p>The Mexicans and Mayas believed themselves to be akin to each other,
they had several deities and a large stock of traditional lore in
common, <span class="sidenote">Maya culture very closely related to Mexican.</span>
and there was an essential similarity in their modes of life; so
that, since we are now assured that such cities as Izamal and
Chichen-Itza were contemporary with the city of Mexico, we shall
probably not go very far astray if we assume that the elaborately carved
and bedizened ruins of the former may give us some hint as to how things
might have looked in the latter. Indeed this complicated and grotesque
carving on walls, door-posts, and lintels was one of the first things to
attract the attention of the Spaniards in Mexico. They regarded it with
mingled indignation and awe, for serpents, coiled or uncoiled, with
gaping mouths, were most conspicuous among the objects represented. The
visitors soon learned that all this had a symbolic and religious
meaning, and with some show of reason they concluded that this strange
people worshipped the Devil.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have now passed in review the various peoples of North America, from
the Arctic circle to the neighbourhood of the isthmus of Darien, and can
form some sort of a mental picture of the continent at the time of its
discovery by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Much more might have
been said without going beyond the requirements of an outline sketch,
but quite as much has been said as is consistent with the general plan
of this book. I have not undertaken at present to go beyond the isthmus
of Darien, because this preliminary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> chapter is already
disproportionately long, and after this protracted discussion the
reader's attention may be somewhat relieved by an entire change of
scene. Enough has been set forth to explain the narrative that follows,
and to justify us henceforth in taking certain things for granted. The
outline description of Mexico will be completed when we come to the
story of its conquest by Spaniards, and then we shall be ready to
describe some principal features of Peruvian society and to understand
how the Spaniards conquered that country.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is, however, one conspicuous feature of North American antiquity
which has not yet received our attention, and which calls for a few
words before we close this chapter. <span class="sidenote">The "Mound-Builders."</span>
I refer to the mounds that are
scattered over so large a part of the soil of the United States, and
more particularly to those between the Mississippi river and the
Alleghany mountains, which have been the subject of so much theorizing,
and in late years of so much careful study.<a id="footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a><a href="#footnote155" title="Go to footnote 155"><span class="small">[155]</span></a> Vague <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> and
wild were the speculations once rife about the "Mound-Builders" and
their wonderful civilization. They were supposed to have been a race
quite different from the red men, with a culture perhaps superior to our
own, and more or less eloquence was wasted over the vanished "empire" of
the mound-builders. There is no reason, however, for supposing that
there ever was an empire of any sort in ancient North America, and no
relic of the past has ever been seen at any spot on our planet which
indicates the former existence of a vanished civilization even remotely
approaching our own. The sooner the student of history gets his head
cleared of all such rubbish, the better. As for the mounds, which are
scattered in such profusion over the country west of the Alleghanies,
there are some which have been built by Indians <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> since the
arrival of white men in America, and which contain knives and trinkets
of European manufacture. There are many others which are much older, and
in which the genuine remains sometimes indicate a culture like that of
Shawnees or Senecas, and sometimes suggest something perhaps a little
higher. With the progress of research the vast and vague notion of a
distinct race of <span class="sidenote">The notion that they were like the Aztecs;</span>
"Mound-Builders" became narrowed and defined. It began
to seem probable that the builders of the more remarkable mounds were
tribes of Indians who had advanced beyond the average level in
horticulture, and consequently in density of population, and perhaps in
political and priestly organization. Such a conclusion seemed to be
supported by the size of some of the "ancient garden-beds," often
covering more than a hundred acres, filled with the low parallel ridges
in which corn was planted. The mound people were thus supposed to be
semi-civilized red men, like the Aztecs, and some of their elevated
earthworks were explained as places for human sacrifice, like the
pyramids of Mexico and Central America. It was thought that the
"civilization" of the Cordilleran peoples might formerly have extended
northward and eastward into the Mississippi valley, and might after a
while have been pushed back by powerful hordes of more barbarous
invaders. A further modification and reduction of this theory likened
the mound-builders to the pueblo Indians of New Mexico. Such was the
opinion of Mr. Morgan, who offered a very ingenious explanation of the
extensive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span> earthworks at High Bank, in Ross county, Ohio, as
the fortified site of a pueblo.<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a><a href="#footnote156" title="Go to footnote 156"><span class="small">[156]</span></a> Although there is no reason for
supposing that the mound-builders practised irrigation (which would not
be required in the Mississippi valley) or used adobe-brick, <span class="sidenote">or like the Zuñis.</span>
yet Mr.
Morgan was inclined to admit them into his middle status of barbarism
because of the copper hatchets and chisels found in some of the mounds,
and because of the apparent superiority in horticulture and the
increased reliance upon it. He suggested that a people somewhat like the
Zuñis might have migrated eastward and modified their building habits to
suit the altered conditions of the Mississippi valley, where they dwelt
for several centuries, until at last, for some unknown reason, they
retired to the Rocky Mountain region. It seems to me that an opinion
just the reverse of Mr. Morgan's would be more easily
defensible,&mdash;namely, that the ancestors of the pueblo Indians were a
people of building habits somewhat similar to the Mandans, and that
their habits became modified in adaptation to a country which demanded
careful irrigation and supplied adobe-clay in abundance. If ever they
built any of the mounds in the Mississippi valley, I should be disposed
to place their mound-building period before their pueblo period.</p>

<p>Recent researches, however, make it more and more improbable that the
mound-builders were nearly akin to such people as the Zuñis or similar
to them in grade of culture. Of late years the exploration <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span> of
the mounds has been carried on with increasing diligence. More than
2,000 mounds have been opened, and at least 38,000 ancient relics have
been gathered from them: such as quartzite arrow-heads and spades,
greenstone axes and hammers, mortars and pestles, tools for spinning and
weaving, and cloth, made of spun thread and woven with warp and woof,
somewhat like a coarse sail-cloth. The water-jugs, kettles, pipes, and
sepulchral urns have been elaborately studied.
<span class="sidenote">The mounds were probably built by different peoples in the
lower status of barbarism;</span>
The net results of all
this investigation, up to the present time, have been concisely summed
up by Dr. Cyrus Thomas.<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a><a href="#footnote157" title="Go to footnote 157"><span class="small">[157]</span></a> The mounds were not all built by one
people, but by different tribes as clearly distinguishable from one
another as Algonquins are distinguishable from Iroquois. These
mound-building tribes were not superior in culture to the Iroquois and
many of the Algonquins as first seen by white men. They are not to be
classified with Zuñis, still less with Mexicans or Mayas, in point of
culture, but with Shawnees and Cherokees. Nay more,&mdash;some of them <i>were</i>
Shawnees and Cherokees. The missionary Johann Heckewelder long ago
published the Lenape tradition of the Tallegwi or Allighewi people, who
have left their name upon the Alleghany river and mountains.<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158" title="Go to footnote 158"><span class="small">[158]</span></a> The
Tallegwi have been identified <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span> with the Cherokees, who are now
reckoned among the most intelligent and progressive of Indian
peoples.<a id="footnotetag159" name="footnotetag159"></a><a href="#footnote159" title="Go to footnote 159"><span class="small">[159]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">by Cherokees;</span>
The Cherokees were formerly classed in the Muskoki group,
along with the Creeks and Choctaws, but a closer study of their language
seems to show that they were a somewhat remote offshoot of the
Huron-Iroquois stock. For a long time they occupied the country between
the Ohio river and the Great Lakes, and probably built the mounds that
are still to be seen there. Somewhere about the thirteenth or fourteenth
century they were gradually pushed southward into the Muskoki region by
repeated attacks from the Lenape and Hurons. The Cherokees were probably
also the builders of the mounds of eastern Tennessee and western North
Carolina. They retained their mound-building habits some time after the
white men came upon the scene. <span class="sidenote">and by Shawnees, and other tribes.</span>
On the other hand the mounds and
box-shaped stone graves of Kentucky, Tennessee, and northern Georgia
were probably the work of Shawnees, and the stone graves in the Delaware
valley are to be ascribed to the Lenape. There are many reasons for
believing that the mounds of northern Mississippi were constructed by
Chickasaws, and the burial tumuli and "effigy mounds" of Wisconsin by
Winnebagos. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span> The Minnitarees and Mandans were also very likely
at one time a mound-building people.</p>

<p>If this view, which is steadily gaining ground, be correct, our
imaginary race of "Mound-Builders" is broken up and vanishes, and
henceforth we may content ourselves with speaking of the authors of the
ancient earthworks as "Indians." There were times in the career of
sundry Indian tribes when circumstances induced them to erect mounds as
sites for communal houses or council houses, medicine-lodges or
burial-places; somewhat as there was a period in the history of our own
forefathers in England when circumstances led them to build moated
castles, with drawbridge and portcullis; and there is no more occasion
for assuming a mysterious race of "Mound-Builders" in America than for
assuming a mysterious race of "Castle-Builders" in England.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thus, at whatever point we touch the subject of ancient America, we find
scientific opinion tending more and more steadily toward the conclusion
that its people and their culture were indigenous.
<span class="sidenote">Society in America at the time of the Discovery had reached
stages similar to stages reached by eastern Mediterranean peoples fifty
or sixty centuries earlier.</span>
One of the most
important lessons impressed upon us by a long study of comparative
mythology is that human minds in different parts of the world, but under
the influence of similar circumstances, develop similar ideas and clothe
them in similar forms of expression. It is just the same with political
institutions, with the development of the arts, with social customs,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span> with culture generally. To repeat the remark already quoted
from Sir John Lubbock,&mdash;and it is well worth repeating,&mdash;"Different
races in similar stages of development often present more features of
resemblance to one another than the same race does to itself in
different stages of its history." When the zealous Abbé Brasseur found
things in the history of Mexico that reminded him of ancient Egypt, he
hastened to the conclusion that Mexican culture was somehow "derived"
from that of Egypt. It was natural enough for him to do so, but such
methods of explanation are now completely antiquated. Mexican culture
was no more Egyptian culture than a prickly-pear is a lotus. It was an
outgrowth of peculiar American conditions acting upon the aboriginal
American mind, and such of its features as remind us of ancient Egypt or
prehistoric Greece show simply that it was approaching, though it had
not reached, the standard attained in those Old World countries. From
this point of view the resemblances become invested with surpassing
interest. Ancient America, as we have seen, was a much more archaic
world than the world of Europe and Asia, and presented in the time of
Columbus forms of society that on the shores of the Mediterranean had
been outgrown before the city of Rome was built. Hence the intense and
peculiar fascination of American archæology, and its profound importance
to the student of general history.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>


<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span> CHAPTER II.<br>

<span class="smaller">PRE-COLUMBIAN VOYAGES.</span></h2>


<p>There is something solemn and impressive in the spectacle of human life
thus going on for countless ages in the Eastern and Western halves of
our planet, each all unknown to the other and uninfluenced by it. The
contact between the two worlds practically begins in 1492.</p>

<p>By this statement it is not meant to deny that occasional visitors may
have come and did come before that famous date from the Old World to the
New. On the contrary I am inclined to suspect that there may have been
more such occasional visits than we have been wont to suppose. For the
most part, however, the subject is shrouded in the mists of obscure
narrative and fantastic conjecture. <span class="sidenote">The Chinese.</span>
When it is argued that in the fifth
century of the Christian era certain Buddhist missionary priests came
from China by way of Kamtchatka and the Aleutian islands, and kept on
till they got to a country which they called Fusang, and which was
really Mexico, one cannot reply that such a thing was necessarily and
absolutely impossible; but when other critics assure us that, after all,
Fusang was really Japan, perhaps one feels a slight sense of
relief.<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a><a href="#footnote160" title="Go to footnote 160"><span class="small">[160]</span></a> So of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> the dim whispers of voyages to America

we may say that this sort of thing has not much to do with

in the seventh century,<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a><a href="#footnote162" title="Go to footnote 162"><span class="small">[162]</span></a> and in the course of this book we shall
have frequent occasion to observe that first and last there has been on
all seas a good deal of blowing and drifting done. It is credibly
reported that Japanese junks have been driven ashore on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span>

bear a critical examination.<a id="footnotetag166" name="footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166" title="Go to footnote 166"><span class="small">[166]</span></a></p>

<p>It is not my purpose to weary the reader with a general discussion of
these and some other legends or rumours of pre-Columbian visitors to
America. We may admit, at once, that "there is no good reason why any
one of them may not have done" what is claimed,
<span class="sidenote">Those stories are of little value;</span>
but at the same time the
proof that any one of them <i>did</i> do it is very far from
satisfactory.<a id="footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167" title="Go to footnote 167"><span class="small">[167]</span></a> Moreover the questions raised are often of small
importance, and belong not so much to the serious workshop of history as
to its limbo prepared for learned trifles, whither we will hereby
relegate them.<a id="footnotetag168" name="footnotetag168"></a><a href="#footnote168" title="Go to footnote 168"><span class="small">[168]</span></a></p>

<p>But when we come to the voyages of the Northmen in the tenth and
eleventh centuries, <span class="sidenote">but the case of the Northmen is entirely different.</span>
it is quite a different affair. Not only is this a
subject of much historic interest, but in dealing with it we stand for a
great part of the time upon firm historic ground. The narratives which
tell us of Vinland and of Leif Ericsson are closely intertwined with the
authentic history of Norway and Iceland. In the ninth century of our era
there was a process of political consolidation going on in Norway,
somewhat as in England under Egbert and his successors. After a war of
twelve years, King Harold Fairhair overthrew the combined forces of the
Jarls, or small independent princes, in the decisive naval battle of
Hafursfiord in the year 872. <span class="sidenote">The Viking exodus from Norway.</span>
This resulted in making Harold the feudal
landlord of Norway. Allodial tenures were abolished, and the Jarls were
required to become his vassals. This consolidation of the kingdom was
probably beneficial in its main consequences, but to many a proud spirit
and crafty brain it made life in Norway unendurable. These bold Jarls
and their Viking<a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a><a href="#footnote169" title="Go to footnote 169"><span class="small">[169]</span></a> followers, to whom, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span> as to the ancient
Greeks, the sea was not a barrier, but a highway,<a id="footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a><a href="#footnote170" title="Go to footnote 170"><span class="small">[170]</span></a> had no mind to
stay at home and submit to unwonted thraldom. So they manned their
dragon-prowed keels, invoked the blessing of Wodan, god of storms, upon
their enterprise, and sailed away. Some went to reinforce their kinsmen
who were making it so hot for Alfred in England<a id="footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a><a href="#footnote171" title="Go to footnote 171"><span class="small">[171]</span></a> and for Charles the
Bald in Gaul; some had already visited Ireland and were establishing
themselves at Dublin and Limerick; others now followed and found homes
for themselves in the Hebrides and all over Scotland north of glorious
Loch Linnhe and the Murray frith; some made their way through the blue
Mediterranean to "Micklegard," the Great City of the Byzantine Emperor,
and in his service wielded their stout axes against Magyar and
Saracen;<a id="footnotetag172" name="footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172" title="Go to footnote 172"><span class="small">[172]</span></a> some found their amphibious natures better satisfied upon
the islands of the Atlantic ridge,&mdash;the Orkneys, Shetlands, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span>
and Færoes, and especially noble Iceland.
<span class="sidenote">Founding of Iceland, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 874.</span>
There an aristocratic republic
soon grew up, owning slight and indefinite allegiance to the kings of
Norway.<a id="footnotetag173" name="footnotetag173"></a><a href="#footnote173" title="Go to footnote 173"><span class="small">[173]</span></a> The settlement of Iceland was such a wholesale colonization
of communities of picked men as had not been seen since ancient Greek
times, and was not to be seen again until Winthrop sailed into
Massachusetts Bay. It was not long before the population of Iceland
exceeded 50,000 souls. Their sheep and cattle flourished, hay crops were
heavy, a lively trade&mdash;with fish, oil, butter, skins, and wool, in
exchange for meal and malt&mdash;was kept up with Norway, Denmark, and the
British islands, political freedom was unimpaired,<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a><a href="#footnote174" title="Go to footnote 174"><span class="small">[174]</span></a> justice was (for

new community in wealth<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175" title="Go to footnote 175"><span class="small">[175]</span></a> and culture was surprisingly rapid. In the
twelfth century, before literature had begun to blossom in the modern
speech of France or Spain or Italy, there was a flourishing literature
in prose and verse in Iceland. Especial attention was paid to history,
and the "Landnáma-bók," or statistical and genealogical account of the
early settlers, was the most complete and careful work of the kind which
had ever been undertaken by any people down to quite recent times. Few
persons in our day adequately realize the extent of the early Icelandic
literature or its richness. The poems, legends, and histories earlier
than the date when Dante walked and mused in the streets of Florence
survive for us now in some hundreds of works, for the most part of rare
and absorbing interest. The "Heimskringla," or chronicle of Snorro
Sturleson, written about 1215, is one of the greatest history books in
the world.<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a><a href="#footnote176" title="Go to footnote 176"><span class="small">[176]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span>

<p>Now from various Icelandic chronicles<a id="footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a><a href="#footnote177" title="Go to footnote 177"><span class="small">[177]</span></a> we learn that in 876, only
two years after the island commonwealth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> was founded, one of
the settlers named <span class="sidenote">Discovery of Greenland, 876.</span>
Gunnbjörn was driven by foul weather to some point on
the coast of Greenland, where he and his crew contrived to pass the
winter, their ship being locked in ice; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span> when the spring set
them free, they returned to Iceland. In the year 983 Eric the Red, a
settler upon Öxney (Ox-island) near the mouth of Breidafiord, was
outlawed for killing a man in a brawl. Eric then determined to search
for the western land which Gunnbjörn had discovered. He set out with a
few followers, and in the next three years these bold sailors explored
the coasts of Greenland pretty thoroughly for a considerable distance on
each side of Cape Farewell. At length they found a suitable place for a
home, at the head of Igaliko fiord, not far from the site of the modern
Julianeshaab.<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a><a href="#footnote178" title="Go to footnote 178"><span class="small">[178]</span></a> It was fit work for Vikings to penetrate so deep a
fiord and find out such a spot, hidden as it is by miles upon miles of
craggy and ice-covered headlands. They proved their sagacity by pitching
upon one of the pleasantest spots on the gaunt Greenland coast; and
there upon a smooth grassy plain may still be seen the ruins of
seventeen houses built of rough blocks of sandstone, their chinks
caulked up with clay and gravel. <span class="sidenote">Eric's Colony in Greenland, 986.</span>
In contrast with most of its bleak
surroundings the place might well be called Greenland, and so Eric named
it, for, said he, it is well to have a pleasant name if we would induce
people to come hither. The name thus given by Eric to this chosen spot
has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> been extended in modern usage to the whole of the vast
continental region north of Davis strait, for the greater part of which
it is a flagrant misnomer.<a id="footnotetag179" name="footnotetag179"></a><a href="#footnote179" title="Go to footnote 179"><span class="small">[179]</span></a> In 986 Eric ventured back to Iceland,
and was so successful in enlisting settlers for Greenland that on his
return voyage he started with five and twenty ships. The loss from foul
weather and icebergs was cruel. Eleven vessels were lost; the remaining
fourteen, carrying probably from four to five hundred souls, arrived
safely at the head of Igaliko fiord, and began building their houses at
the place called Brattahlid. Their settlement presently extended over
the head of Tunnudliorbik fiord, the next deep inlet to the northwest;
they called it Ericsfiord. After a while it extended westward as far as
Immartinek, and eastward as far as the site of Friedrichsthal; and
another distinct settlement of less extent was also made about four
hundred miles to the northwest, near the present site of Godthaab. The
older settlement, which began at Igaliko fiord, was known as the East
Bygd;<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a><a href="#footnote180" title="Go to footnote 180"><span class="small">[180]</span></a> the younger settlement, near Godthaab, was called the West
Bygd.</p>

<p>The East Bygd, or Eastern Settlement of the
Northmen in Greenland.</p>
</div>

<p>This colonization of Greenland by the Northmen in the tenth century is
as well established as any event that occurred in the Middle Ages. For
four hundred years the fortunes of the Greenland colony formed a part,
albeit a very humble part, of European history. Geographically speaking,
Greenland is reckoned as a part of America, of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span> the western
hemisphere, and not of the eastern. The Northmen who settled in
Greenland had, therefore, in this sense found their way to America.
Nevertheless one rightly feels that in the history of geographical
discovery an arrival of Europeans in Greenland is equivalent merely to
reaching the vestibule or ante-chamber of the western hemisphere. It is
an affair begun and ended outside of the great world of the red men.</p>

<p>But the story does not end here. Into the world of the red men the
voyagers from Iceland did assuredly come, as indeed, after once getting
a foothold upon Greenland, they could hardly fail to do. Let us pursue
the remainder of the story as we find it in our Icelandic sources of
information, and afterwards it will be proper to inquire into the
credibility of these sources.</p>

<p>One of the men who accompanied Eric to Greenland was named Herjulf,
whose son Bjarni, after roving the seas for some years, came home to
Iceland in 986 to drink the Yuletide ale with his father. Finding him
gone, he weighed anchor and started after him to Greenland,
<span class="sidenote">Voyage of Bjarni Herjulfson, 986.</span>
but
encountered foggy weather, and sailed on for many days by guess-work
without seeing sun or stars. When at length he sighted land it was a
shore without mountains, showing only small heights covered with dense
woods. It was evidently not the land of fiords and glaciers for which
Bjarni was looking. So without stopping to make explorations he turned
his prow to the north and kept on. The sky was now fair, and after
scudding nine or ten days with a brisk breeze <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> astern, Bjarni
saw the icy crags of Greenland looming up before him, and after some
further searching found his way to his father's new home.<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a><a href="#footnote181" title="Go to footnote 181"><span class="small">[181]</span></a> On the
route he more than once sighted land on the larboard.</p>

<p>This adventure of Bjarni's seems not to have excited general curiosity
or to have awakened speculation. Indeed, in the dense geographical
ignorance of those times there is no reason why it should have done so.
About 994 Bjarni was in Norway, and one or two people expressed some
surprise that he did not take more pains to learn something about the
country he had seen; but nothing came of such talk till it reached the
ears of Leif, the famous son of Eric the Red. This wise and stately
man<a id="footnotetag182" name="footnotetag182"></a><a href="#footnote182" title="Go to footnote 182"><span class="small">[182]</span></a>
spent a year or two in Norway about 998.
<span class="sidenote">Conversion of the Northmen to Christianity.</span>
Roman missionary
priests were then preaching up and down the land, and had converted the
king, Olaf Tryggvesson, great-grandson of Harold Fairhair. Leif became a
Christian and was baptised, and when he returned to Greenland he took
priests with him who converted many people, though old Eric, it is said,
preferred to go in the way of his fathers, and deemed boisterous
Valhalla, with its cups of wassail, a place of better cheer than the New
Jerusalem, with its streets of gold.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span>

<p>Leif's zeal for the conversion of his friends in Greenland did not so
far occupy his mind as to prevent him from undertaking a voyage of
discovery. His curiosity had been stimulated by what he had heard about
Bjarni's experiences, and he made up his mind to go and see what the
coasts to the south of Greenland were like. He sailed from
<span class="sidenote">Leif Ericsson's voyage, 1000.</span>
Brattahlid&mdash;probably in the summer or early autumn of the year
1000<a id="footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a><a href="#footnote183" title="Go to footnote 183"><span class="small">[183]</span></a>&mdash;with a crew of five and thirty men. Some distance to the
southward they came upon a barren country covered with big flat stones,
so that they called it Helluland,
<span class="sidenote">Helluland.</span>
or "slate-land." There is little room
for doubt that this was the coast opposite Greenland, either west or
east of the strait of Belle Isle; in other words, it was either Labrador
or the northern coast of Newfoundland. Thence, keeping generally to the
southward, our explorers came after some days to a thickly wooded coast,
where they landed and inspected the country. What chiefly impressed them
was the extent of the forest, so that they called the place Markland,
<span class="sidenote">Markland.</span>
or
"wood-land." Some critics have supposed that this spot was somewhere
upon the eastern or southern coast of Newfoundland, but the more general
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> opinion places it somewhere upon the coast of Cape Breton
island or Nova Scotia. From this Markland our voyagers stood out to sea,
and running briskly before a stiff northeaster it was more than two days
before they came in sight of land. Then, after following the coast for a
while, they went ashore at a place where a river, issuing from a lake,
fell into the sea. They brought their ship up into the lake and cast
anchor. The water abounded in excellent fish, and the country seemed so
pleasant that Leif decided to pass the winter there, and accordingly his
men put up some comfortable wooden huts or booths. One day one of the
party, a "south country" man, whose name was Tyrker,<a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a><a href="#footnote184" title="Go to footnote 184"><span class="small">[184]</span></a> came in from a
ramble in the neighbourhood making grimaces and talking to himself in
his own language <span class="sidenote">Vinland.</span>
(probably German), which his comrades did not
understand. On being interrogated as to the cause of his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span>
excitement, he replied that he had discovered vines loaded with grapes,
and was much pleased at the sight inasmuch as he had been brought up in
a vine country. Wild grapes, indeed, abounded in this autumn season, and
Leif accordingly called the country Vinland. The winter seems to have
passed off very comfortably. Even the weather seemed mild to these
visitors from high latitudes, and they did not fail to comment on the
unusual length of the winter day. Their language on this point has been
so construed as to make the length of the shortest winter day exactly
nine hours, which would place their Vinland in about the latitude of
Boston. But their expressions do not admit of any such precise
construction; and when we remember that they had no accurate instruments
for measuring time, and that a difference of about fourteen minutes
between sunrise and sunset on the shortest winter day would make all the
difference between Boston and Halifax, we see how idle it is to look for
the requisite precision in narratives of this sort, and to treat them as
one would treat the reports of a modern scientific exploring expedition.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1001 Leif returned to Greenland with a cargo of
timber.<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a><a href="#footnote185" title="Go to footnote 185"><span class="small">[185]</span></a> The voyage made much talk. Leif's brother Thorvald caught
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> inspiration,<a id="footnotetag186" name="footnotetag186"></a><a href="#footnote186" title="Go to footnote 186"><span class="small">[186]</span></a> and, borrowing Leif's ship, sailed in
1002, and succeeded in finding Vinland and Leif's huts, where his men
spent two winters.
<span class="sidenote">Voyages of Thorvald and Thorstein, 1002-05.</span>
In the intervening summer they went on an exploring
expedition along the coast, fell in with some savages in canoes, and got
into a fight in which Thorvald was killed by an arrow. In the spring of
1004 the ship returned to Brattahlid. Next year the third brother,
Thorstein Ericsson, set out in the same ship, with his wife Gudrid and a
crew of thirty-five men; but they were sore bestead with foul weather,
got nowhere, and accomplished nothing. Thorstein died on the voyage, and
his widow returned to Greenland.</p>

<p>In the course of the next summer, 1006, there came to Brattahlid from
Iceland a notable personage, a man of craft and resource, wealthy withal
and well born, with the blood of many kinglets or jarls flowing in his
veins. This man, Thorfinn Karlsefni, straightway fell in love with the
young and beautiful widow Gudrid, and in the course of the winter there
was a merry wedding at Brattahlid.
<span class="sidenote">Thorfinn Karlsefni, and his unsuccessful attempt to found a
colony in Vinland, 1007-10.</span>
Persuaded by his adventurous bride,
whose spirit had been roused by the reports from Vinland and by her
former unsuccessful attempt to find it, Thorfinn now undertook to visit
that country in force sufficient for founding a colony there.
Accordingly in the spring of 1007 he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> started with three or
four ships,<a id="footnotetag187" name="footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187" title="Go to footnote 187"><span class="small">[187]</span></a> carrying one hundred and sixty men, several women, and
quite a cargo of cattle. In the course of that year his son Snorro was
born in Vinland,<a id="footnotetag188" name="footnotetag188"></a><a href="#footnote188" title="Go to footnote 188"><span class="small">[188]</span></a> and our chronicle tells us that this child was
three years old before the disappointed company turned their backs upon
that land of promise and were fain to make their way homeward to the
fiords of Greenland. It was the hostility of the natives that compelled
Thorfinn to abandon his enterprise. At first they traded with him,
bartering valuable furs for little strips of scarlet cloth which they
sought most eagerly; and they were as terribly frightened by his cattle
as the Aztecs were in later days by the Spanish horses.<a id="footnotetag189" name="footnotetag189"></a><a href="#footnote189" title="Go to footnote 189"><span class="small">[189]</span></a> The chance
bellowing of a bull sent them squalling to the woods, and they did not
show themselves again for three weeks. After a while quarrels arose, the
natives attacked in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> great numbers, many Northmen were killed,
and in 1010 the survivors returned to Greenland with a cargo of timber
and peltries. On the way thither the ships seem to have separated, and
one of them, commanded by Bjarni Grimolfsson, found itself bored by
worms (the <i>teredo</i>) and sank, with its commander and half the
crew.<a id="footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a><a href="#footnote190" title="Go to footnote 190"><span class="small">[190]</span></a></p>

<p>Among Karlsefni's companions on this memorable expedition was one
Thorvard, with his wife Freydis, a natural daughter of Eric the Red.
About the time of their return to Greenland in the summer of 1010, a
ship arrived from Norway, commanded by two brothers, Helgi and Finnbogi.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> During the winter a new expedition was planned, and in the
summer of 1011
<span class="sidenote">Freydis, and her evil deeds in Vinland, 1011-12.</span>
two ships set sail for Vinland, one with Freydis,
Thorvard, and a crew of 30 men, the other with Helgi and Finnbogi, and a
crew of 35 men. There were also a number of women. The purpose was not
to found a colony but to cut timber. The brothers arrived first at
Leif's huts and had begun carrying in their provisions and tools, when
Freydis, arriving soon afterward, ordered them off the premises. They
had no right, she said, to occupy her brother's houses. So they went out
and built other huts for their party a little farther from the shore.
Before their business was accomplished "winter set in, and the brothers
proposed to have some games for amusement to pass the time. So it was
done for a time, till discord came among them, and the games were given
up, and none went from one house to the other; and things went on so
during a great part of the winter." At length came the catastrophe.
Freydis one night complained to her husband that the brothers had given
her evil words and struck her, and insisted that he should forthwith
avenge the affront. Presently Thorvard, unable to bear her taunts, was
aroused to a deed of blood. With his followers he made a night attack
upon the huts of Helgi and Finnbogi, seized and bound all the occupants,
and killed the men one after another in cold blood. Five women were left
whom Thorvard would have spared; as none of his men would raise a hand
against them, Freydis herself took an axe and brained them one and all.
In the spring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span> of 1012 the party sailed for Brattahlid in the
ship of the murdered brothers, which was the larger and better of the
two. Freydis pretended that they had exchanged ships and left the other
party in Vinland. With gifts to her men, and dire threats for any who
should dare tell what had been done, she hoped to keep them silent.
Words were let drop, however, which came to Leif's ears, and led him to
arrest three of the men and put them to the torture until they told the
whole story. "'I have not the heart,' said Leif, 'to treat my wicked
sister as she deserves; but this I will foretell them [Freydis and
Thorvard] that their posterity will never thrive.' So it went that
nobody thought anything of them save evil from that time."</p>

<p>With this grewsome tale ends all account of Norse attempts at exploring
or colonizing Vinland, though references to Vinland by no means end
here.<a id="footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a><a href="#footnote191" title="Go to footnote 191"><span class="small">[191]</span></a> Taking the narrative as a whole, it seems to me a sober,
straightforward, and eminently probable story.
<span class="sidenote">The whole story is eminently probable.</span>
We may not be able to say
with confidence exactly where such places as Markland and Vinland were,
but it is clear that the coasts visited on these southerly and
southwesterly voyages from Brattahlid must have been parts of the coast
of North America, unless the whole story is to be dismissed as a figment
of somebody's imagination. But for a figment of the imagination, and of
European <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> imagination withal, it has far too many points of
verisimilitude, as I shall presently show.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is an extremely probable story from the time that
Eric once gets settled in Brattahlid. The founding of the Greenland
colony is the only strange or improbable part of the narrative, but that
is corroborated in so many other ways that we know it to be true; as
already observed, no fact in mediæval history is better established.
When I speak of the settlement of Greenland as strange, I do not mean
that there is anything strange in the Northmen's accomplishing the
voyage thither from Iceland. That island is nearer to Greenland than to
Norway, and we know, moreover, that Norse sailors achieved more
difficult things than penetrating the fiords of southern Greenland. Upon
the island of Kingitorsook in Baffin's Bay (72° 55' N., 56° 5' W.)
<span class="sidenote">Voyage into Baffin's Bay, 1135.</span>
near
Upernavik, in a region supposed to have been unvisited by man before the
modern age of Arctic exploration, there were found in 1824 some small
artificial mounds with an inscription upon stone:&mdash;"Erling Sighvatson
and Bjarni Thordharson and Eindrid Oddson raised these marks and cleared
ground on Saturday before Ascension Week, 1135." That is to say, they
took symbolic possession of the land.<a id="footnotetag192" name="footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192" title="Go to footnote 192"><span class="small">[192]</span></a></p>

<p>In order to appreciate how such daring voyages were practicable, we must
bear in mind that the Viking "ships" were probably stronger and more
seaworthy, and certainly much swifter, than the Spanish vessels of the
time of Columbus. One <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span> was unearthed a few years ago at
Sandefiord in Norway, and may be seen at the museum in Christiania.
<span class="sidenote">A Viking ship discovered at Sandefiord, in Norway.</span>
Its
pagan owner had been buried in it, and his bones were found amidships,
along with the bones of a dog and a peacock, a few iron fish-hooks and
other articles. Bones of horses and dogs, probably sacrificed at the
funeral according to the ancient Norse custom, lay scattered about. This
craft has been so well described by Colonel Higginson,<a id="footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a><a href="#footnote193" title="Go to footnote 193"><span class="small">[193]</span></a> that I may
as well quote the passage in full:&mdash;</p>

<p>She "was seventy-seven feet eleven inches at the greatest length, and
sixteen feet eleven inches at the greatest width, and from the top of
the keel to the gunwale amidships she was five feet nine inches deep.
She had twenty ribs, and would draw less than four feet of water. She
was clinker-built; that is, had plates slightly overlapped, like the
shingles on the side of a house. The planks and timbers of the frame
were fastened together with withes made of roots, but the oaken boards
of the side were united by iron rivets firmly clinched. The bow and
stern were similar in shape, and must have risen high out of water, but
were so broken that it was impossible to tell how they originally ended.
<span class="sidenote">Description of the ship.</span>
The keel was deep and made of thick oak beams, and there was no trace of
any metallic sheathing; but an iron anchor was found almost rusted to
pieces. There was no deck and the seats for rowers had been taken out.
The oars were twenty feet long, and the oar-holes, sixteen on each side,
had slits sloping towards the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span> stern to allow the blades of the
oars to be put through from inside. The most peculiar thing about the
ship was the rudder, which was on the starboard or right side, this side
being originally called 'steerboard' from this circumstance. The rudder
was like a large oar, with long blade and short handle, and was
attached, not to the side of the boat, but to the end of a conical piece
of wood which projected almost a foot from the side of the vessel, and
almost two feet from the stern. This piece of wood was bored down its
length, and no doubt a rope passing through it secured the rudder to the
ship's side. It was steered by a tiller attached to the handle, and
perhaps also by a rope fastened to the blade. As a whole, this
disinterred vessel proved to be anything but the rude and primitive
craft which might have been expected; it was neatly built and well
preserved, constructed on what a sailor would call beautiful lines, and
eminently fitted for sea service. Many such vessels may be found
depicted on the celebrated Bayeux tapestry; and the peculiar position of
the rudder explains the treaty mentioned in the Heimskringla, giving to
Norway all lands lying west of Scotland between which and the mainland a
vessel could pass with her rudder shipped.... This was not one of the
very largest ships, for some of them had thirty oars on each side, and
vessels carrying from twenty to twenty-five were not uncommon. The
largest of these were called Dragons, and other sizes were known as
Serpents or Cranes. The ship itself was often so built as to represent
the name it bore: the dragon, for instance, was a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span> long low
vessel, with the gilded head of a dragon at the bow, and the gilded tail
at the stern; the moving oars at the side might represent the legs of
the imaginary creature, the row of shining red and white shields that
were hung over the gunwale looked like the monster's scales, and the
sails striped with red and blue might suggest his wings. The ship
preserved at Christiania is described as having had but a single mast,
set into a block of wood so large that it is said no such block could
now be cut in Norway. Probably the sail was much like those still
carried by large open boats in that country,&mdash;a single square on a mast
forty feet long.<a id="footnotetag194" name="footnotetag194"></a><a href="#footnote194" title="Go to footnote 194"><span class="small">[194]</span></a> These masts have no standing rigging, and are
taken down when not in use; and this was probably the practice of the
Vikings."</p>

<p>In such vessels, well stocked with food and weapons, the Northmen were
accustomed to spend many weeks together on the sea, now and then
touching land. In such vessels they made their way to Algiers and
Constantinople, to the White Sea, to Baffin's Bay. It is not, therefore,
their voyage to Greenland that seems strange, but it is their success in
founding a colony which could last for more than four centuries in that
inhospitable climate. The question is sometimes asked whether the
climate of Greenland <span class="sidenote">The climate of Greenland.</span>
may not have undergone some change within the last
thousand years.<a id="footnotetag195" name="footnotetag195"></a><a href="#footnote195" title="Go to footnote 195"><span class="small">[195]</span></a> If there has been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span> any change, it must
have been very slight; such as, perhaps, a small variation in the flow
of ocean currents might occasion. I am inclined to believe that there
may have been such a change, from the testimony of Ivar Bardsen, steward
of the Gardar bishopric in the latter half of the fourteenth century, or
about halfway between the time of Eric the Red and our own time.
According to Bardsen there had long been a downward drifting of ice from
the north and a consequent accumulation of bergs and floes upon the
eastern coast of Greenland, insomuch that the customary route formerly
followed by ships coming from Iceland was no longer safe, and a more
southerly route had been generally adopted.<a id="footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a><a href="#footnote196" title="Go to footnote 196"><span class="small">[196]</span></a> This slow southward
extension of the polar ice-sheet upon the east of Greenland seems still
to be going on at the present day.<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href="#footnote197" title="Go to footnote 197"><span class="small">[197]</span></a> It is therefore not at all
improbable, but on the contrary quite probable, that a thousand years
ago the mean annual temperature of the tip end of Greenland, at Cape
Farewell, was a few degrees <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> higher than now.<a id="footnotetag198" name="footnotetag198"></a><a href="#footnote198" title="Go to footnote 198"><span class="small">[198]</span></a> But a slight
difference of this sort might have an important bearing upon the
fortunes of a colony planted there. For example, it would directly
affect the extent of the hay crop. Grass grows very well now in the
neighbourhood of Julianeshaab. In summer it is still a "green land,"
with good pasturage for cattle, but there is difficulty in getting hay
enough to last through the nine months of winter. In 1855 "there were in
Greenland 30 to 40 head of horned cattle, about 100 goats, and 20
sheep;" but in the ancient colony, with a population not exceeding 6,000
persons, "herds of cattle were kept which even yielded produce for
exportation to Europe."<a id="footnotetag199" name="footnotetag199"></a><a href="#footnote199" title="Go to footnote 199"><span class="small">[199]</span></a> So strong a contrast seems to indicate a
much more plentiful grass crop than to-day, although some hay might
perhaps have been imported from Iceland in exchange for Greenland
exports, which were chiefly whale oil, eider-down, and skins of seals,
foxes, and white bears.</p>

<p>When once the Northmen had found their way to Cape Farewell, it would
have been marvellous if such active sailors could long have avoided
stumbling upon the continent of North America. Without compass or
astrolabe these daring men were accustomed to traverse long stretches of
open <span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span> sea, trusting to the stars;
<span class="sidenote">With the Northmen once in Greenland, the discovery of the
American continent was almost inevitable.</span>
and it needed only a stiff
northeasterly breeze, with persistent clouds and fog, to land a westward
bound "dragon" anywhere from Cape Race to Cape Cod. This is what appears
to have happened to Bjarni Herjulfsson in 986, and something quite like
it happened to Henry Hudson in 1609.<a id="footnotetag200" name="footnotetag200"></a><a href="#footnote200" title="Go to footnote 200"><span class="small">[200]</span></a> Curiosity is a motive quite
sufficient to explain Leif's making the easy summer voyage to find out
what sort of country Bjarni had seen. He found it thickly wooded, and as
there was a dearth of good timber both in Greenland and in Iceland, it
would naturally occur to Leif's friends that voyages for timber, to be
used at home and also to be exported to Iceland, <span class="sidenote">Voyages for timber.</span>
might turn out to be
profitable.<a id="footnotetag201" name="footnotetag201"></a><a href="#footnote201" title="Go to footnote 201"><span class="small">[201]</span></a> As Laing says, "to go in quest of the wooded countries
to the southwest, from whence driftwood came to their shores, was a
reasonable, intelligible motive for making a voyage in search of the
lands from whence it came, and where this valuable material could be got
for nothing."<a id="footnotetag202" name="footnotetag202"></a><a href="#footnote202" title="Go to footnote 202"><span class="small">[202]</span></a></p>

<p>If now we look at the details of the story we shall find many ear-marks
of truth in it. We must not look for absolute accuracy in a narrative
which&mdash;as we have it&mdash;is not the work of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> Leif or Thorfinn or
any of their comrades, but of compilers or copyists, honest and careful
as it seems to me, but liable to misplace details and to call by wrong
names things which they had never seen. Starting with these modest
expectations we shall find the points of verisimilitude numerous.
<span class="sidenote">Ear-marks of truth in the narrative.</span>
To
begin with the least significant, somewhere on our northeastern coast
the voyagers found many foxes.<a id="footnotetag203" name="footnotetag203"></a><a href="#footnote203" title="Go to footnote 203"><span class="small">[203]</span></a> These animals, to be sure, are found
in a great many countries, but the point for us is that in a southerly
and southwesterly course from Cape Farewell these sailors are said to
have found them. If our narrators had been drawing upon their
imaginations or dealing with semi-mythical materials, they would as
likely as not have lugged into the story elephants from Africa or
hippogriffs from Dreamland; mediæval writers were blissfully ignorant of
all canons of probability in such matters.<a id="footnotetag204" name="footnotetag204"></a><a href="#footnote204" title="Go to footnote 204"><span class="small">[204]</span></a> But our narrators simply
mention an animal which has for ages abounded on our northeastern
coasts. One such instance is enough to suggest that they were following
reports or documents which emanated ultimately from eye-witnesses and
told the plain truth. A dozen such instances, if not neutralized by
counter-instances, are enough to make this view extremely probable; and
then one or two instances <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> which could not have originated in
the imagination of a European writer will suffice to prove it.</p>

<p>Let us observe, then, that on coming to Markland they "slew a
bear;"<a id="footnotetag205" name="footnotetag205"></a><a href="#footnote205" title="Go to footnote 205"><span class="small">[205]</span></a> the river and lake (or bay) in Vinland abounded with salmon
bigger than Leif's people had ever seen;<a id="footnotetag206" name="footnotetag206"></a><a href="#footnote206" title="Go to footnote 206"><span class="small">[206]</span></a> on the coast they caught
halibut;<a id="footnotetag207" name="footnotetag207"></a><a href="#footnote207" title="Go to footnote 207"><span class="small">[207]</span></a> they came to an island where there were so many eider
ducks breeding that they could hardly avoid treading on their eggs;<a id="footnotetag208" name="footnotetag208"></a><a href="#footnote208" title="Go to footnote 208"><span class="small">[208]</span></a>
and, as already observed, it was because of the abundance of wild grapes
that Leif named the southernmost country he visited Vinland.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span>

<p>From the profusion of grapes&mdash;such that the ship's stern boat is said on
one occasion to have been filled with them<a id="footnotetag209" name="footnotetag209"></a><a href="#footnote209" title="Go to footnote 209"><span class="small">[209]</span></a>&mdash;we get a clue, though
less decisive than could be wished, to the location of Vinland. The
extreme northern limit of the vine in Canada is 47°,
<span class="sidenote">Northern limit of the vine.</span>
the parallel which
cuts across the tops of Prince Edward and Cape Breton islands on the
map.<a id="footnotetag210" name="footnotetag210"></a><a href="#footnote210" title="Go to footnote 210"><span class="small">[210]</span></a> Near this northern limit, however, wild grapes are by no means
plenty; so that the coast upon which Leif wintered must apparently have
been south of Cape Breton. Dr. Storm, who holds that Vinland was on the
southern coast of Nova Scotia, has collected some interesting testimony
as to the growth of wild grapes in that region, but on the whole the
abundance of this fruit seems rather to point to the shores of
Massachusetts Bay.<a id="footnotetag211" name="footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211" title="Go to footnote 211"><span class="small">[211]</span></a></p>

<p>We may now observe that, while it is idle to attempt to determine
accurately the length of the winter day,
<span class="sidenote">Length of the winter day.</span>
as given in our chronicles,
nevertheless since that length attracted the attention of the voyagers,
as something remarkable, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span> it may fairly be supposed to indicate
a latitude lower than they were accustomed to reach in their trading
voyages in Europe. Such a latitude as that of Dublin, which lies
opposite Labrador, would have presented no novelty to them, for voyages
of Icelanders to their kinsmen in Dublin, and in Rouen as well, were
common enough. Halifax lies about opposite Bordeaux, and Boston a little
south of opposite Cape Finisterre, in Spain, so that either of these
latitudes would satisfy the conditions of the case; either would show a
longer winter day than Rouen, which was about the southern limit of
ordinary trading voyages from Iceland. At all events, the length of day
indicates for Vinland a latitude south of Cape Breton.</p>

<p>The next point to be observed is the mention of "self-sown
wheat-fields."<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a><a href="#footnote212" title="Go to footnote 212"><span class="small">[212]</span></a> This is not only an important ear-mark of truth in
the narrative, but it helps us somewhat further in determining the
position of Vinland. The "self-sown" cereal, which these Icelanders
called "wheat," was in all probability what the English settlers six
hundred years afterward called "corn," <span class="sidenote">Indian corn.</span>
in each case applying to a new
and nameless thing the most serviceable name at hand. In England "corn"
means either wheat, barley, rye, and oats collectively, or more
specifically wheat; in Scotland it generally means oats; in America it
means maize, the "Indian corn," the cereal peculiar to the western
hemisphere. The beautiful waving plant, with its exquisitely tasselled
ears, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span> was one of the first things to attract Champlain's
attention, could not have escaped the notice of such keen observers as
we are beginning to find Leif and Thorfinn to have been. A cereal like
this, requiring so little cultivation that without much latitude of
speech it might be described as growing wild, would be interesting to
Europeans visiting the American coast; but it would hardly occur to
European fancy to invent such a thing. The mention of it is therefore a
very significant ear-mark of the truth of the narrative. As regards the
position of Vinland, the presence of maize seems to indicate a somewhat
lower latitude than Nova Scotia. Maize requires intensely hot summers,
and even under the most careful European cultivation does not flourish
north of the Alps. In the sixteenth century its northern-most limit on
the American coast seems to have been at the mouth of the Kennebec
(44°), though farther inland it was found by Cartier at Hochelaga, on
the site of Montreal (45° 30'). A presumption is thus raised in favour
of the opinion that Vinland was not farther north than Massachusetts
Bay.<a id="footnotetag213" name="footnotetag213"></a><a href="#footnote213" title="Go to footnote 213"><span class="small">[213]</span></a></p>

<p>This presumption is supported by what is said about the climate of
Vinland, though it must be borne in mind that general statements about
climate are apt to be very loose and misleading. We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> are told
that it seemed to Leif's people that cattle would be able to pass the
winter out of doors there, <span class="sidenote">Winter weather in Vinland.</span>
for there was no frost and the grass was not
much withered.<a id="footnotetag214" name="footnotetag214"></a><a href="#footnote214" title="Go to footnote 214"><span class="small">[214]</span></a> On the other hand, Thorfinn's people found the
winter severe, and suffered from cold and hunger.<a id="footnotetag215" name="footnotetag215"></a><a href="#footnote215" title="Go to footnote 215"><span class="small">[215]</span></a> Taken in
connection with each other, these two statements would apply very well
to-day to our variable winters on the coast southward from Cape Ann. The
winter of 1889-90 in Cambridge, for example, might very naturally have
been described by visitors from higher latitudes as a winter without
frost and with grass scarcely withered. Indeed, we might have described
it so ourselves. On Narragansett and Buzzard's bays such soft winter
weather is still more common; north of Cape Ann it is much less common.
The severe winter (<i>magna hiems</i>) is of course familiar enough anywhere
along the northeastern coast of America.</p>

<p>On the whole, we may say with some confidence that the place described
by our chroniclers <span class="sidenote">Probable situation of Vinland.</span>
as Vinland was situated somewhere between Point
Judith and Cape Breton; possibly we may narrow our limits and say
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> that it was somewhere between Cape Cod and Cape Ann. But the
latter conclusion is much less secure than the former. In such a case as
this, the more we narrow our limits the greater our liability to
error.<a id="footnotetag216" name="footnotetag216"></a><a href="#footnote216" title="Go to footnote 216"><span class="small">[216]</span></a> While by such narrowing, moreover, the question may acquire
more interest as a bone of contention among local antiquarians, its
value for the general historian is not increased.</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with the points of verisimilitude in our story.
We have now to cite two or three details that are far more striking than
any as yet mentioned,&mdash;details that could never have been conjured up by
the fancy of any mediæval European. <span class="sidenote">"Savages" unknown to mediæval Europeans.</span>
We must bear in mind that "savages,"
whether true savages or people in the lower status of barbarism, were
practically unknown to Europeans before the fifteenth century. There
were no such people in Europe or in any part of Asia or Africa visited
by Europeans before the great voyages of the Portuguese. Mediæval
Europeans knew nothing whatever about people who would show surprise at
the sight of an iron tool<a id="footnotetag217" name="footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217" title="Go to footnote 217"><span class="small">[217]</span></a> or frantic terror at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> voice
of a bull, or who would eagerly trade off valuable property for
worthless trinkets. Their imagination might be up to inventing
hobgoblins and people with heads under their shoulders,<a id="footnotetag218" name="footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218" title="Go to footnote 218"><span class="small">[218]</span></a> but it was
not up to inventing such simple touches of nature as these. Bearing this
in mind, let us observe that Thorfinn found the natives of Vinland eager
to give valuable furs<a id="footnotetag219" name="footnotetag219"></a><a href="#footnote219" title="Go to footnote 219"><span class="small">[219]</span></a> in exchange for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> little strips of
scarlet cloth to bind about their heads. When the Northmen found the
cloth growing scarce they cut it into extremely narrow strips, but the
desire of the natives was so great that they would still give a whole
skin for the smallest strip. <span class="sidenote">The natives of Vinland.</span>
They wanted also to buy weapons, but
Thorfinn forbade his men to sell them. One of the natives picked up an
iron hatchet and cut wood with it; one after another tried and admired
it; at length one tried it on a stone and broke its edge, and then they
scornfully threw it down.<a id="footnotetag220" name="footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220" title="Go to footnote 220"><span class="small">[220]</span></a> One day while they were trading,
Thorfinn's bull ran out before them and bellowed, whereupon the whole
company was instantly scattered in headlong flight. After this, when
threatened with an attack by the natives, Thorfinn drew up his men for a
fight and put the bull in front, very much as Pyrrhus used elephants&mdash;at
first with success&mdash;to frighten the Romans and their horses.<a id="footnotetag221" name="footnotetag221"></a><a href="#footnote221" title="Go to footnote 221"><span class="small">[221]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span>

<p>These incidents are of surpassing interest, for they were attendant upon
the first meeting (in all probability) that ever took place between
civilized Europeans and any people below the upper status of
barbarism.<a id="footnotetag222" name="footnotetag222"></a><a href="#footnote222" title="Go to footnote 222"><span class="small">[222]</span></a> Who were these natives encountered by Thorfinn? The
Northmen called them "Skrælings," a name which one is at first sight
strongly tempted to derive from the Icelandic verb <i>skrækja</i>, identical
with the English <i>screech</i>. A crowd of excited Indians might most
appropriately be termed Screechers.<a id="footnotetag223" name="footnotetag223"></a><a href="#footnote223" title="Go to footnote 223"><span class="small">[223]</span></a> This derivation, however, is
not correct. <span class="sidenote">Meaning of the epithet "Skrælings."</span>
The word <i>skræling</i> survives in modern Norwegian, and means
a feeble or puny or <i>insignificant</i> person. Dr. Storm's suggestion is in
all probability correct, that the name "Skrælings," as applied to the
natives of America, had no ethnological significance, but simply meant
"inferior people;" it gave concise expression to the white man's opinion
that they were "a bad lot." In Icelandic literature the name is usually
applied to the Eskimos, and hence it has been rashly inferred that
Thorfinn found Eskimos in Vinland. Such was Rafn's opinion, and since
his time the commentators <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> have gone off upon a wrong trail and
much ingenuity has been wasted.<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a><a href="#footnote224" title="Go to footnote 224"><span class="small">[224]</span></a> It would be well to remember,
however, that the Europeans of the eleventh century were not
ethnologists; in meeting these inferior peoples for the first time they
were more likely to be impressed with the broad fact of their
inferiority than to be nice in making distinctions. When we call both
Australians and Fuegians "savages," we do not assert identity or
relationship between them; and so when the Northmen called Eskimos and
Indians by the same disparaging epithet, they doubtless simply meant to
call them savages.</p>


<p>Our chronicle describes the Skrælings of Vinland as swarthy in hue,
ferocious in aspect, with ugly hair, big eyes, and broad cheeks.<a id="footnotetag225" name="footnotetag225"></a><a href="#footnote225" title="Go to footnote 225"><span class="small">[225]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Personal appearance of the Skrælings.</span>
This will do very well for Indians, except as to the eyes. We are
accustomed to think of Indian eyes as small; but in this connection it
is worthy of note that a very keen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> observer, Marc Lescarbot,
in his minute and elaborate description of the physical appearance of
the Micmacs of Acadia, speaks with some emphasis of their large
eyes.<a id="footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a><a href="#footnote226" title="Go to footnote 226"><span class="small">[226]</span></a> Dr. Storm quite reasonably suggests that the Norse expression
may refer to the size not of the eye-ball, but of the eye-socket, which
in the Indian face is apt to be large; and very likely this is what the
Frenchman also had in mind.</p>

<p>These Skrælings were clad in skins, and their weapons were bows and
arrows, slings, and stone hatchets. In the latter we may now, I think,
be allowed to recognize the familiar tomahawk; and when we read that, in
a sharp fight with the natives, Thorbrand, son of the commander Snorro,
was slain, and the woman Freydis afterward found his corpse in the
woods, with a flat stone sticking in the head, and his naked sword lying
on the ground beside him, we seem to see how it all happened.<a id="footnotetag227" name="footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227" title="Go to footnote 227"><span class="small">[227]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">The Skrælings of Vinland were Indians,&mdash;very likely
Algonquins.</span>
We
seem to see the stealthy Indian suddenly dealing the death-blow, and
then obliged for his own safety to dart away among the trees without
recovering his tomahawk or seizing the sword. The Skrælings came up the
river or lake in a swarm of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> canoes, all yelling at the top of
their voices (<i>et illi omnes valde acutum ululabant</i>), and, leaping
ashore, began a formidable attack with slings and arrows. The narrative
calls these canoes "skin-boats" (<i>hudhkeipar</i>), whence it has been
inferred that the writer had in mind the <i>kayaks</i> and <i>umiaks</i> of the
Eskimos.<a id="footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a><a href="#footnote228" title="Go to footnote 228"><span class="small">[228]</span></a> I suspect that the writer did have such boats in mind, and
accordingly used a word not strictly accurate. Very likely his
authorities failed to specify a distinction between bark-boats and
skin-boats, and simply used the handiest word for designating canoes as
contrasted with their own keeled boats.<a id="footnotetag229" name="footnotetag229"></a><a href="#footnote229" title="Go to footnote 229"><span class="small">[229]</span></a></p>

<p>One other point which must be noticed here in connection with the
Skrælings is a singular man&oelig;uvre which they are said to have
practised in the course of the fight. They raised upon the end of a pole
a big ball, not unlike a sheep's paunch, and of a bluish colour; this
ball they swung from the pole over the heads of the white men, and it
fell to the ground with a horrid noise.<a id="footnotetag230" name="footnotetag230"></a><a href="#footnote230" title="Go to footnote 230"><span class="small">[230]</span></a> Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> according to
Mr. Schoolcraft, this was a mode of fighting formerly common among the
Algonquins, in New England and elsewhere. This big ball was what Mr.
Schoolcraft calls the "balista," or what the Indians themselves call the
"demon's head." It was a large round boulder, sewed up in a new skin and
attached to a pole. As the skin dried it enwrapped the stone tightly;
and then it was daubed with grotesque devices in various colours. "It
was borne by several warriors who acted as balisteers. Plunged upon a
boat or canoe, it was capable of sinking it. Brought down upon a group
of men on a sudden, it produced consternation and death."<a id="footnotetag231" name="footnotetag231"></a><a href="#footnote231" title="Go to footnote 231"><span class="small">[231]</span></a> This is a
most remarkable feature in the narrative, for it shows us the Icelandic
writer (here manifestly controlled by some authoritative source of
information) describing a very strange mode of fighting, which we know
to have been characteristic of the Algonquins. Karlsefni's men do not
seem to have relished this outlandish style of fighting; they retreated
along the river bank until they came to a favourable situation among
some rocks, where they made a stand and beat off their swarming
assailants. The latter, as soon as they found themselves losing many
warriors without gaining their point, suddenly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> turned and fled
to their canoes, and paddled away with astonishing celerity. Throughout
the account it seems to me perfectly clear that we are dealing with
Indians.</p>

<p>The coexistence of so many unmistakable marks of truth in our narratives
may fairly be said to amount to a demonstration that they must be
derived, through some eminently trustworthy channel, from the statements
of intelligent eye-witnesses who took part in the events related. Here
and there, no doubt, we come upon some improbable incident or a touch of
superstition, such as we need not go back to the eleventh century to
<span class="sidenote">The uniped.</span>
find very common among seamen's narratives; but the remarkable thing in
the present case is that there are so few such features. One fabulous
creature is mentioned. Thorfinn and his men saw from their vessel a
glittering speck upon the shore at an opening in the woods. They hailed
it, whereupon the creature proceeded to perform the quite human act of
shooting an arrow, which killed the man at the helm. The narrator calls
it a "uniped," or some sort of one-footed goblin,<a id="footnotetag232" name="footnotetag232"></a><a href="#footnote232" title="Go to footnote 232"><span class="small">[232]</span></a> but that is
hardly reasonable, for after the shooting it went on to perform the
further quite human and eminently Indian-like act of running away.<a id="footnotetag233" name="footnotetag233"></a><a href="#footnote233" title="Go to footnote 233"><span class="small">[233]</span></a>
Evidently this discreet "uniped" was impressed with the desirableness of
living to fight <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> another day. In a narrative otherwise
characterized by sobriety, such an instance of fancy, even supposing it
to have come down from the original sources, counts for as much or as
little as Henry Hudson's description of a mermaid.<a id="footnotetag234" name="footnotetag234"></a><a href="#footnote234" title="Go to footnote 234"><span class="small">[234]</span></a></p>

<hr>

<p>It is now time for a few words upon the character of the records upon
which our story is based. And first, let us remark upon a possible
source of misapprehension due to the associations with which a certain
Norse word has been clothed. The old Norse narrative-writings are called
"sagas," a word which we are in the habit of using in English as
equivalent to legendary or semi-mythical narratives.
<span class="sidenote">Misleading associations with the word "saga."</span>
To cite a "saga" as
authority for a statement seems, therefore, to some people as
inadmissible as to cite a fairy-tale; and I cannot help suspecting that
to some such misleading association of ideas is due the particular form
of the opinion expressed some time ago by a committee of the
Massachusetts Historical Society,&mdash;"that there is the same sort of
reason for believing in the existence of Leif Ericsson that there is for
believing in the existence of Agamemnon. They are both traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> accepted by later writers, and there is no more reason for
regarding as true the details
<span class="sidenote">Unfortunate comparison between Leif Ericsson and Agamemnon.</span>
related about the discoveries of the
former than there is for accepting as historic truth the narrative
contained in the Homeric poems." The report goes on to observe that "it
is antecedently probable that the Northmen discovered America in the
early part of the eleventh century; and this discovery is confirmed by
the same sort of historical tradition, not strong enough to be called
evidence, upon which our belief in many of the accepted facts of history
rests."<a id="footnotetag235" name="footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235" title="Go to footnote 235"><span class="small">[235]</span></a> The second of these statements is characterized by critical
moderation, and expresses the inevitable and wholesome reaction against
the rash enthusiasm of Professor Rafn half a century ago, and the
vagaries of many an uninstructed or uncritical writer since his time.
But the first statement is singularly unfortunate. It would be difficult
to find a comparison more inappropriate than that between Agamemnon and
Leif, <span class="sidenote">The story of the Trojan War, as we have it, is pure
folk-lore.</span>
between the Iliad and the Saga of Eric the Red. The story of the
Trojan War and its heroes, as we have it in Homer and the Athenian
dramatists, is pure folk-lore as regards form, and chiefly folk-lore as
regards contents. It is in a high degree probable that this mass of
folk-lore surrounds a kernel of plain fact, that in times long before
the first Olympiad an actual "king of men" at Mycenæ conducted an
expedition against the great city by the Simois, that the Agamemnon of
the poet stands in some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> such relation toward this chieftain as
that in which the Charlemagne of mediæval romance stands toward the
mighty Emperor of the West.<a id="footnotetag236" name="footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236" title="Go to footnote 236"><span class="small">[236]</span></a> Nevertheless the story, as we have it,
is simply folk-lore. If the Iliad and Odyssey contain faint
reminiscences of actual events, these events are so inextricably wrapped
up with mythical phraseology that by no cunning of the scholar can they
be construed into history. The motives and capabilities of the actors
and the conditions under which they accomplish their destinies are such
as exist only in fairy-tales. Their world is as remote from that in
which we live as the world of Sindbad and Camaralzaman; and this is not
essentially altered by the fact that Homer introduces us to definite
localities and familiar customs as often as the Irish legends of Finn
M'Cumhail.<a id="footnotetag237" name="footnotetag237"></a><a href="#footnote237" title="Go to footnote 237"><span class="small">[237]</span></a></p>

<p>It would be hard to find anything more unlike such writings than the
class of Icelandic sagas to which that of Eric the Red belongs.
<span class="sidenote">The Saga of Eric the Red is not folk-lore.</span>
Here we
have quiet and sober narrative, not in the least like a fairy-tale, but
often much like a ship's log. Whatever such narrative may be, it is not
folk-lore. In act and motive, in its conditions and laws, its world is
the every-day world in which we live. If now and then a "uniped" happens
to stray into it, the incongruity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span> is as conspicuous as in the
case of Hudson's mermaid, or a ghost in a modern country inn; whereas in
the Homeric fabric the supernatural is warp and woof. To assert a
likeness between two kinds of literature so utterly different is to go
very far astray.</p>

<p>As already observed, I suspect that misleading associations with the
word "saga" may have exerted an unconscious influence in producing this
particular kind of blunder,&mdash;for it is nothing less than a blunder.
Resemblance is tacitly assumed between the Iliad and an Icelandic saga.
Well, between the Iliad and <i>some</i> Icelandic sagas there is a real and
strong resemblance. In truth these sagas are divisible into two well
marked and sharply contrasted classes. In the one class belong the Eddic
Lays, and the <span class="sidenote">Mythical and historical sagas.</span>
<i>mythical sagas</i>, such as the Volsunga, the stories of
Ragnar, Frithiof, and others; and along with these, though totally
different in source, we may for our present purpose group the <i>romantic
sagas</i>, such as Parceval, Remund, Karlamagnus, and others brought from
southern Europe. These are alike in being composed of legendary and
mythical materials; they belong essentially to the literature of
folk-lore. In the other class come the <i>historical sagas</i>, such as those
of Njal and Egil, the Sturlunga, and many others, with the numerous
biographies and annals.<a id="footnotetag238" name="footnotetag238"></a><a href="#footnote238" title="Go to footnote 238"><span class="small">[238]</span></a> These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> writings give us history,
and often very good history indeed. "Saga" meant simply any kind of
literature in narrative form; the good people of Iceland did not happen
to have such a handy word as "history," which they could keep entire
when they meant it in sober earnest and chop down into "story" when they
meant it otherwise. It is very much as if we were to apply the same word
to the Arthur legends and to William of Malmesbury's judicious and
accurate chronicles, and call them alike "stories."</p>

<p>The narrative upon which our account of the Vinland voyages is chiefly
based belongs to the class of historical sagas. It is the Saga of Eric
the Red, and it exists in two different versions, of which one seems to
have been made in the north, the other in the west, of Iceland. The
western version is the earlier and in some respects the better.
<span class="sidenote">The western or Hauks-bók version of Eric the Red's Saga.</span>
It is
found in two vellums, that of the great collection known as <i>Hauks-bók</i>
(AM. 544), and that which is simply known as AM. 557 from its catalogue
number in Arni Magnusson's collection. Of these the former, which is the
best preserved, was written in a beautiful hand by Hauk Erlendsson,
between 1305 and 1334, the year of his death. This western version is
the one which has generally been printed under the title, "Saga of
Thorfinn Karlsefni." It is the one to which I have most frequently
referred in the present chapter.<a id="footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a><a href="#footnote239" title="Go to footnote 239"><span class="small">[239]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>

<p>The northern version is that which was made about the year 1387 by the
priest Jón Thórdharson, and contained in the famous compilation known as
the <i>Flateyar-bók</i>, or <span class="sidenote">The northern or Flateyar-bók version.</span>
"Flat Island Book."<a id="footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a><a href="#footnote240" title="Go to footnote 240"><span class="small">[240]</span></a> This priest was editing
the saga of King Olaf Tryggvesson, which is contained in that
compilation, and inasmuch as Leif Ericsson's presence at King Olaf's
court was connected both with the introduction of Christianity into
Greenland and with the discovery of Vinland, Jón paused, after the
manner of mediæval chroniclers, and inserted then and there what he knew
about Eric and Leif and Thorfinn. In doing this, he used parts of the
original saga of Eric the Red (as we find it reproduced in the western
version), and added thereunto a considerable amount of material
concerning the Vinland voyages derived from other sources. Jón's version
thus made has generally been printed under the title, "Saga of Eric the
Red."<a id="footnotetag241" name="footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241" title="Go to footnote 241"><span class="small">[241]</span></a></p>

<p>Now the older version, written at the beginning of the fourteenth
century, gives an account of things which happened three centuries
before it was written. A cautious scholar will, as a rule, be slow to
consider any historical narrative as quite <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> satisfactory
authority, even when it contains no improbable statements,
<span class="sidenote">Presumption against sources not contemporary.</span>
unless it is
nearly contemporary with the events which it records. Such was the rule
laid down by the late Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and it is a very good
rule; the proper application of it has disencumbered history of much
rubbish. At the same time, like all rules, it should be used with
judicious caution and not allowed to run away with us. As applied by
Lewis to Roman history it would have swept away in one great cataclysm
not only kings and decemvirs, but Brennus and his Gauls to boot, and
left us with nothing to swear by until the invasion of Pyrrhus.<a id="footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a><a href="#footnote242" title="Go to footnote 242"><span class="small">[242]</span></a>
Subsequent research has shown that this was going altogether too far.
The mere fact of distance in time between a document and the events
which it records is only negative testimony against its value, for it
may be a faithful transcript of some earlier document or documents since
lost. It is so difficult to prove a negative that the mere lapse of time
simply raises a presumption the weight of which should be estimated by a
careful survey of all the probabilities in the case. Among the many
Icelandic vellums that are known to have perished<a id="footnotetag243" name="footnotetag243"></a><a href="#footnote243" title="Go to footnote 243"><span class="small">[243]</span></a> there <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span>
may well have been earlier copies of Eric the Red's Saga.</p>

<p>Hauk Erlendsson reckoned himself a direct descendant, in the eighth
generation, from Snorro, son of Thorfinn and Gudrid, born in Vinland. He
was an important personage in Iceland, a man of erudition, author of a
brief book of contemporary annals and a treatise on arithmetic in which
he introduced the Arabic numerals into Iceland. In those days the lover
of books, <span class="sidenote">Hauk Erlendsson and his manuscripts.</span>
if he would add them to his library, might now and then obtain
an original manuscript, but usually he had to copy them or have them
copied by hand. The Hauks-bók, with its 200 skins, one of the most
extensive Icelandic vellums now in existence, is really Hauk's private
library, or what there is left of it, and it shows that he was a man who
knew how to make a good choice of books. He did a good deal of his
copying himself, and also employed two clerks in the same kind of
work.<a id="footnotetag244" name="footnotetag244"></a><a href="#footnote244" title="Go to footnote 244"><span class="small">[244]</span></a></p>

<p>Now I do not suppose it will occur to any rational being to suggest that
Hauk may have written down his version of Eric the Red's Saga from an
oral tradition nearly three centuries old. The narrative could not have
been so long preserved in its integrity, with so little extravagance of
statement and so many marks of truthfulness in details foreign to
ordinary Icelandic experience, if <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> it had been entrusted to
oral tradition alone. <span class="sidenote">The story is not likely to have been preserved to Hauk's time
by oral tradition only.</span>
One might as well try to imagine Drake's "World
Encompassed" handed down by oral tradition from the days of Queen
Elizabeth to the days of Queen Victoria. Such transmission is possible
enough with heroic poems and folk-tales, which deal with a few dramatic
situations and a stock of mythical conceptions familiar at every
fireside; but in a simple matter-of-fact record of sailors' observations
and experiences on a strange coast, oral tradition would not be long in
distorting and jumbling the details into a result quite undecipherable.
The story of the Zeno brothers, presently to be cited, shows what
strange perversions occur, even in written tradition, when the copyist,
instead of faithfully copying records of unfamiliar events, tries to
edit and amend them. One cannot reasonably doubt that Hauk's vellum of
Eric the Red's Saga, with its many ear-marks of truth above mentioned,
was copied by him&mdash;and quite carefully and faithfully withal&mdash;from some
older vellum not now forthcoming.</p>

<p>As we have no clue, however, beyond the internal evidence, to the age or
character of the sources from which Hauk copied, <span class="sidenote">Allusions to Vinland in other documents.</span>
there is nothing left
for us to do but to look into other Icelandic documents, to see if
anywhere they betray a knowledge of Vinland and the voyages thither.
Incidental references to Vinland, in narratives concerned with other
matters, are of great significance in this connection; for they imply on
the part of the narrator a presumption that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span> his readers
understand such references, and that it is not necessary to interrupt
his story in order to explain them. Such incidental references imply the
existence, during the interval between the Vinland voyages and Hauk's
manuscript, of many intermediate links of sound testimony that have
since dropped out of sight; and therefore they go far toward removing
whatever presumption may be alleged against Hauk's manuscript because of
its distance from the events.</p>

<p>Now the Eyrbyggja Saga, written between 1230 and 1260, is largely
devoted to the settlement of Iceland, and is full of valuable notices of
the heathen institutions and customs of the tenth century. <span class="sidenote">Eyrbyggja Saga.</span>
The
Eyrbyggja, having occasion to speak of Thorbrand Snorrason, observes
incidentally that he went from Greenland to Vinland with Karlsefni and
was killed in a battle with the Skrælings.<a id="footnotetag245" name="footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245" title="Go to footnote 245"><span class="small">[245]</span></a> We have already
mentioned the death of this Thorbrand, and how Freydis found his body in
the woods.</p>

<p>Three Icelandic tracts on geography, between the twelfth and fourteenth
centuries, mention Helluland and Vinland, and in two of these accounts
Markland is interposed between Helluland and Vinland.<a id="footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a><a href="#footnote246" title="Go to footnote 246"><span class="small">[246]</span></a> One of these
tracts mentions the voyages of Leif and Thorfinn. It forms part of an
essay called "Guide to the Holy Land," by <span class="sidenote">The abbot Nikulas, etc.</span>
Nikulas <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> Sæmundsson,
abbot of Thvera, in the north of Iceland, who died 1159. This Nikulas
was curious in matters of geography, and had travelled extensively.</p>

<p>With the celebrated Ari Thorgilsson, usually known as Fródhi, "the
learned," we come to testimony nearly contemporaneous in time and
extremely valuable in character. This erudite priest, born in 1067, was
the founder of historical writing in Iceland. He was the principal
author of the <span class="sidenote">Ari Fródhi.</span>
"Landnáma-bók," already mentioned as a work of thorough
and painstaking research unequalled in mediæval literature. His other
principal works were the "Konunga-bók," or chronicle of the kings of
Norway, and the "Islendinga-bók," or description of Iceland.<a id="footnotetag247" name="footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247" title="Go to footnote 247"><span class="small">[247]</span></a> Ari's
books, written not in monkish Latin, but in a good vigorous vernacular,
were a mine of information from which all subsequent Icelandic
historians were accustomed to draw such treasures as they needed. To his
diligence and acumen they were all, from Snorro Sturlason down, very
much indebted. He may be said to have given the tone to history-writing
in Iceland, and it was a high tone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Ari's Islendinga-bók has perished. One cannot help
suspecting that it may have contained the contemporary materials from
which Eric the Red's Saga in the Hauks-bók was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> ultimately
drawn. For Ari made an abridgment or epitome of his great book, and this
epitome, commonly known as "Libellus Islandorum," still survives. In it
Ari makes brief mention of Greenland, and refers to his paternal uncle,
Thorkell Gellison, as authority for his statements. This Thorkell
Gellison, of Helgafell, <span class="sidenote">Ari's significant allusion to Vinland.</span>
a man of high consideration who flourished about
the middle of the eleventh century, had visited Greenland and talked
with one of the men who accompanied Eric when he went to settle in
Brattahlid in 986. From this source Ari gives us the interesting
information that Eric's party found in Greenland "traces of human
habitations, fragments of boats, and stone implements; so from this one
might conclude that people of the kind who inhabited Vinland and were
known by the (Norse) Greenlanders as Skrælings must have roamed about
there."<a id="footnotetag248" name="footnotetag248"></a><a href="#footnote248" title="Go to footnote 248"><span class="small">[248]</span></a> Observe the force of this allusion. The settlers in
Greenland did not at first (nor for a long time) meet with barbarous or
savage natives there, but only with the vestiges of their former
presence. But when Ari wrote the above passage, the memory of Vinland
and its fierce Skrælings was still fresh, and Ari very properly inferred
from the archæological remains in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span> Greenland that a people
similar (in point of barbarism) to the Skrælings must have been there.
Unless Ari and his readers had a distinct recollection of the accounts
of Vinland, such a reference would have been only an attempt to explain
the less obscure by the more obscure. It is to be regretted that we have
in this book no more allusions to Vinland; but if Ari could only leave
us one such allusion, he surely could not have made that one more
pointed.</p>

<p>But this is not quite the only reference that Ari makes to Vinland.
There are three others that must in all probability be assigned to him.
Two occur in the Landnáma-bók, the first in a passage where mention is
made of Ari Marsson's voyage to a place in the western ocean near
Vinland;<a id="footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a><a href="#footnote249" title="Go to footnote 249"><span class="small">[249]</span></a> the only point in this allusion which need here concern us
is that <span class="sidenote">Other references.</span>
Vinland is tacitly assumed to be a known geographical situation
to which others may be referred. The second reference occurs in one of
those elaborate and minutely specific genealogies in the Landnáma-bók:
"Their son was Thordhr Hest-höfdhi, father of Karlsefni, who found
Vinland the Good, Snorri's father," etc.<a id="footnotetag250" name="footnotetag250"></a><a href="#footnote250" title="Go to footnote 250"><span class="small">[250]</span></a> The third reference occurs
in the Kristni Saga, a kind of supplement to the Landnáma-bók, giving an
account of the introduction of Christianity into Iceland; here it is
related how Leif Ericsson came to be called "Leif the Lucky," 1. from
having rescued a shipwrecked crew off the coast of Greenland, 2. from
having <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> discovered "Vinland the Good."<a id="footnotetag251" name="footnotetag251"></a><a href="#footnote251" title="Go to footnote 251"><span class="small">[251]</span></a> From these brief
allusions, and from the general relation in which Ari Fródhi stood to
later writers, I suspect that if the greater Islendinga-bók had survived
to our time we should have found in it more about Vinland and its
discoverers. At any rate, as to the existence of a definite and
continuous tradition all the way from Ari down to Hauk Erlendsson, there
can be no question whatever.<a id="footnotetag252" name="footnotetag252"></a><a href="#footnote252" title="Go to footnote 252"><span class="small">[252]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span>

<p>The testimony of Adam of Bremen brings us yet one generation nearer to
the Vinland voyages, and is very significant. <span class="sidenote">Adam of Bremen.</span>
Adam was much interested
in the missionary work in the north of Europe, and in 1073, the same
year that Hildebrand was elected to the papacy, he published his famous
"Historia Ecclesiastica" in which he gave an account of the conversion
of the northern nations from the time of Leo III. to that of
Hildebrand's predecessor. In prosecuting his studies, Adam made a visit
to the court of Swend Estridhsen, king of Denmark, nephew of Cnut the
Great, king of Denmark and England. Swend's reign began in 1047, so that
Adam's visit must have occurred between that date and 1073. The voyage
of Leif and Thorfinn would at that time have been within the memory of
living men, and would be likely to be known in Denmark, because the
intercourse between the several parts of the Scandinavian world was
incessant; there was continual coming and going. Adam learned what he
could of Scandinavian geography, and when he published his history, he
did just what a modern writer would do under similar circumstances; he
appended to his book some notes on the geography of those remote
countries, then so little known to his readers in central and southern
Europe. After giving some account of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, he
describes the colony in Iceland, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> then the further colony
in Greenland, and concludes by saying that out in that ocean there is
another country, or island, which has been visited by many persons, and
is called Vinland because of wild grapes that grow there, out of which a
very good wine can be made. Either rumour had exaggerated the virtues of
fox-grape juice, or the Northmen were not such good judges of wine as of
ale. Adam goes on to say that corn, likewise, grows in Vinland without
cultivation; and as such a statement to European readers must needs have
a smack of falsehood, he adds that it is based not upon fable and
guess-work, but upon "trustworthy reports (<i>certa relatione</i>) of the
Danes."</p>


<p>Scanty as it is, this single item of strictly contemporary testimony is
very important, because quite incidentally it gives to the later
accounts such confirmation as to show that they rest upon a solid basis
of continuous tradition and not upon mere unintelligent hearsay.<a id="footnotetag253" name="footnotetag253"></a><a href="#footnote253" title="Go to footnote 253"><span class="small">[253]</span></a>
The unvarying character of the tradition, in its essential details,
indicates that it must have been committed to writing at a very early
period, probably not later than the time of Ari's uncle Thorkell, who
was contemporary with Adam of Bremen. If, however, we read the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span>
whole passage in which Adam's mention of Vinland occurs, it is clear
from the context that his own information was not derived from an
inspection of Icelandic documents. He got it, as he tells us, by talking
with King Swend; and all that he got, or all that he thought worth
telling, was this curious fact about vines and self-sown corn growing so
near to Greenland; <span class="sidenote">Adam's misconception of the situation.</span>
for Adam quite misconceived the situation of Vinland,
and imagined it far up in the frozen North. After his mention of
Vinland, the continental character of which he evidently did not
suspect, he goes on immediately to say, "After this island nothing
inhabitable is to be found in that ocean, all being covered with
unendurable ice and boundless darkness." That most accomplished king,
Harold Hardrada, says Adam, tried not long since to ascertain how far
the northern ocean extended, and plunged along through this darkness
until he actually reached the end of the world, and came near tumbling
off!<a id="footnotetag254" name="footnotetag254"></a><a href="#footnote254" title="Go to footnote 254"><span class="small">[254]</span></a> Thus the worthy Adam, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span> while telling the truth about
fox-grapes and maize as well as he knew how, spoiled the effect of his
story by putting Vinland in the Arctic regions. The juxtaposition of
icebergs and vines was a little too close even for the mediæval mind so
hospitable to strange yarns. Adam's readers generally disbelieved the
"trustworthy reports of the Danes," and when they thought of Vinland at
all, doubtless thought of it as somewhere near the North Pole.<a id="footnotetag255" name="footnotetag255"></a><a href="#footnote255" title="Go to footnote 255"><span class="small">[255]</span></a> We
shall do well to bear this in mind when we come to consider the
possibility of Columbus having obtained from Adam of Bremen any hint in
the least likely to be of use in his own enterprise.<a id="footnotetag256" name="footnotetag256"></a><a href="#footnote256" title="Go to footnote 256"><span class="small">[256]</span></a></p>

<hr>

<p>To sum up the argument:&mdash;we have in Eric the Red's Saga, as copied by
Hauk Erlendsson, <span class="sidenote">Summary of the argument.</span>
a document for the existence of which we are required
to account. That document <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> contains unmistakable knowledge of
some things which mediæval Europeans could by no human possibility have
learned, except through a visit to some part of the coast of North
America further south than Labrador or Newfoundland. It tells an
eminently probable story in a simple, straightforward way, agreeing in
its details with what we know of the North American coast between Point
Judith and Cape Breton. Its general accuracy in the statement and
grouping of so many remote details is proof that its statements were
controlled by an exceedingly strong and steady tradition,&mdash;altogether
too strong and steady, in my opinion, to have been maintained simply by
word of mouth. These Icelanders were people so much given to writing
that their historic records during the Middle Ages were, as the late Sir
Richard Burton truly observed, more complete than those of any other
country in Europe.<a id="footnotetag257" name="footnotetag257"></a><a href="#footnote257" title="Go to footnote 257"><span class="small">[257]</span></a> It is probable that the facts mentioned in
Hauk's document rested upon some kind of a written basis as early as the
eleventh century; and it seems quite clear that the constant tradition,
by which all the allusions to Vinland and the Skrælings are controlled,
had become established by that time. The data are more scanty than we
could wish, but they all point in the same direction as surely as straws
blown by a steady wind, and their cumulative force is so great as to
fall but little short of demonstration. For these reasons it seems to me
that the Saga of Eric the Red should be accepted as history; and there
is another reason which might not have counted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> for much at the
beginning of this discussion, but at the end seems quite solid and
worthy of respect. The narrative begins with the colonization of
Greenland and goes on with the visits to Vinland. It is unquestionably
sound history for the first part; why should it be anything else for the
second part? What shall be said of a style of criticism which, in
dealing with one and the same document, arbitrarily cuts it in two in
the middle and calls the first half history and the last half legend?
which accepts its statements as serious so long as they keep to the
north of the sixtieth parallel, and dismisses them as idle as soon as
they pass to the south of it? Quite contrary to common sense, I should
say.</p>

<hr>

<p>The only discredit which has been thrown upon the story of the Vinland
voyages, in the eyes either of scholars or of the general public, has
arisen from the eager credulity with which ingenious
<span class="sidenote">Absurd speculations of zealous antiquarians.</span>
antiquarians have
now and then tried to prove more than facts will warrant. It is
peculiarly a case in which the judicious historian has had frequent
occasion to exclaim, Save me from my friends! The only fit criticism
upon the wonderful argument from the Dighton inscription is a reference
to the equally wonderful discovery made by Mr. Pickwick at Cobham;<a id="footnotetag258" name="footnotetag258"></a><a href="#footnote258" title="Go to footnote 258"><span class="small">[258]</span></a>
and when it was attempted, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> some sixty years ago, to prove that
Governor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> Arnold's old stone windmill at Newport<a id="footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a><a href="#footnote259" title="Go to footnote 259"><span class="small">[259]</span></a> was a
tower built by the Northmen, no wonder if the exposure of this rather
laughable notion should have led many people to suppose that the story
of Leif and Thorfinn had thereby been deprived of some part of its
support. But the story never rested upon any such evidence, and does not
call for evidence of such sort. There is nothing in the story to
indicate that the Northmen ever founded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> a colony in
<span class="sidenote">There is no reason for supposing that the Northmen founded a
colony in Vinland.</span>
Vinland,
or built durable buildings there. The distinction implicitly drawn by
Adam of Bremen, who narrates the colonization of Iceland and Greenland,
and then goes on to speak of Vinland, not as colonized, but simply as
discovered, is a distinction amply borne out by our chronicles. Nowhere
is there the slightest hint of a colony or settlement established in
Vinland. On the contrary, our plain, business-like narrative tells us
that Thorfinn Karlsefni tried to found a colony and failed; and it tells
us why he failed. The Indians were too many for him. The Northmen of the
eleventh century, without firearms, were in much less favourable
condition for withstanding the Indians than the Englishmen of the
seventeenth; and at the former period there existed no cause for
emigration from Norway and Iceland at all comparable to the economic,
political, and religious circumstances which, in a later age, sent
thousands of Englishmen to Virginia and New England. The founding of
colonies in America in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was no
pastime; it was a tale of drudgery, starvation, and bloodshed, that
curdles one's blood to read; more attempts failed than succeeded.
Assuredly Thorfinn gave proof of the good sense ascribed to him when he
turned his back upon Vinland. But if he or any other Northman had ever
succeeded in establishing a colony there, can anybody explain why it
should not have stamped the fact of its existence either upon the soil,
or upon history, or both, as unmistakably as the colony of Greenland?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span> Archæological remains of the Northmen abound in Greenland, all
the way from Immartinek to near Cape Farewell; the existence of one such
relic on the North American continent has never yet been proved.
<span class="sidenote">No archæological remains of the Northmen have been found
south of Davis strait.</span>
Not a
single vestige of the Northmen's presence here, at all worthy of
credence, has ever been found. The writers who have, from time to time,
mistaken other things for such vestiges, have been led astray because
they have failed to distinguish between the different conditions of
proof in Greenland and in Vinland. As Mr. Laing forcibly put the case,
nearly half a century ago, "Greenland was a colony with communications,
trade, civil and ecclesiastical establishments, and a considerable
population," for more than four centuries. "Vinland was only visited by
flying parties of woodcutters, remaining at the utmost two or three
winters, but never settling there permanently.... To expect here, as in
Greenland, material proofs to corroborate the documentary proofs, is
weakening the latter by linking them to a sort of evidence which, from
the very nature of the case,&mdash;the temporary visits of a ship's
crew,&mdash;cannot exist in Vinland, and, as in the case of Greenland, come
in to support them."<a id="footnotetag260" name="footnotetag260"></a><a href="#footnote260" title="Go to footnote 260"><span class="small">[260]</span></a></p>

<p>The most convincing proof that the Northmen never founded a colony in
America, south of Davis strait, is furnished by the total absence of
horses, cattle, and other domestic animals from the soil of North
America until they were brought hither by the Spanish, French, and
English settlers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span> in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
<span class="sidenote">If the Northmen had founded a successful colony, they would
have introduced domestic cattle into the North American fauna;</span>
If the Northmen had ever settled in Vinland, they would have brought
cattle with them, and if their colony had been successful, it would have
introduced such cattle permanently into the fauna of the country.
Indeed, our narrative tells us that Karlsefni's people "had with them
all kinds of cattle, having the intention to settle in the land if they
could."<a id="footnotetag261" name="footnotetag261"></a><a href="#footnote261" title="Go to footnote 261"><span class="small">[261]</span></a> Naturally the two things are coupled in the narrator's
mind. So the Portuguese carried livestock in their earliest
expeditions to the Atlantic islands;<a id="footnotetag262" name="footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262" title="Go to footnote 262"><span class="small">[262]</span></a> Columbus brought horses and
cows, with vines and all kinds of grain, on his second voyage to the
West Indies;<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a><a href="#footnote263" title="Go to footnote 263"><span class="small">[263]</span></a> when the French, under Baron Léry, made a disastrous
attempt to found a colony on or about Cape Breton in 1518, they left
behind them, upon Sable island, a goodly stock of cows and pigs, which
throve and multiplied long after their owners had gone;<a id="footnotetag264" name="footnotetag264"></a><a href="#footnote264" title="Go to footnote 264"><span class="small">[264]</span></a> the
Pilgrims at Plymouth had cattle, goats, and swine as early as 1623.<a id="footnotetag265" name="footnotetag265"></a><a href="#footnote265" title="Go to footnote 265"><span class="small">[265]</span></a>
In fact, it would be difficult to imagine a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span> community of
Europeans subsisting anywhere for any length of time without domestic
animals. We have seen that the Northmen took pains to raise cattle in
Greenland, and were quick to comment upon the climate of Vinland as
favourable for pasturage. To suppose that these men ever founded a
colony in North America, but did not bring domestic animals thither,
would be absurd. But it would be scarcely less absurd to suppose that
such animals, having been once fairly introduced into the fauna of North
America, <span class="sidenote">and such animals could not have vanished and left no trace of
their existence.</span>
would afterward have vanished without leaving a vestige of
their presence. As for the few cattle for which Thorfinn could find room
in his three or four dragon-ships, we may easily believe that his people
ate them up before leaving the country, especially since we are told
they were threatened with famine. But that domestic cattle, after being
supported on American soil during the length of time involved in the
establishment of a successful colony (say, for fifty or a hundred
years), should have disappeared without leaving abundant traces of
themselves, is simply incredible. Horses and kine are not dependent upon
man for their existence; when left to themselves, in almost any part of
the world, they run wild and flourish in what naturalists call a "feral"
state. Thus we find feral horned cattle in the Falkland and in the
Ladrone islands, as well as in the ancient Chillingham Park, in
Northumberland; we find feral pigs in Jamaica; feral European dogs in La
Plata; feral horses in Turkestan, and also in Mexico, descended from
Spanish <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> horses.<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a><a href="#footnote266" title="Go to footnote 266"><span class="small">[266]</span></a> If the Northmen had ever founded a colony
in Vinland, how did it happen that the English and French in the
seventeenth century, and from that day to this, have never set eyes upon
a wild horse, or wild cattle, pigs, or hounds, or any such indication
whatever of the former presence of civilized Europeans? I do not
recollect ever seeing this argument used before, but it seems to me
conclusive. It raises against the hypothesis of a Norse colonization in
Vinland a presumption extremely difficult if not impossible to
overcome.<a id="footnotetag267" name="footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267" title="Go to footnote 267"><span class="small">[267]</span></a>

<p>As for the colony in Greenland, while its population seems never to have
exceeded 5,000 or 6,000 souls, it maintained its existence <span class="sidenote">Further fortunes of the Greenland colony.</span>
and its
intercourse with Europe uninterruptedly from its settlement in 986, by
Eric the Red, for more than four hundred years. Early in the fourteenth
century the West Bygd, or western settlement, near Godthaab, seems to
have contained ninety farmsteads and four churches; while the East Bygd,
or eastern settlement, near Julianeshaab, contained one hundred and
ninety farmsteads, with one cathedral and eleven smaller churches, two
villages, and three or four monasteries.<a id="footnotetag268" name="footnotetag268"></a><a href="#footnote268" title="Go to footnote 268"><span class="small">[268]</span></a> Between Tunnudliorbik and
Igaliko fiords, and about thirty miles from the ruined stone houses of
Brattahlid, there now stands, imposing in its decay, the simple but
massive structure of Kakortok church, once the "cathedral" church of the
Gardar bishopric, where the Credo was intoned and censers swung, while
not less than ten generations lived and died. About the beginning of the
twelfth century there was a movement at Rome for establishing new
dioceses in "the islands of the ocean;" in 1106 a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> bishop's see
was erected in the north of Iceland, and one at about the same time in
the Færoes. In 1112, Eric Gnupsson,<a id="footnotetag269" name="footnotetag269"></a><a href="#footnote269" title="Go to footnote 269"><span class="small">[269]</span></a> having been appointed by Pope
Paschal II. "bishop of Greenland and Vinland <i>in partibus infidelium</i>,"
went from Iceland to organize his new diocese in Greenland. It is
mentioned in at least six different vellums that in 1121 <span class="sidenote">Bishop Eric's voyage in search of Vinland, 1121.</span>
Bishop Eric
"went in search of Vinland."<a id="footnotetag270" name="footnotetag270"></a><a href="#footnote270" title="Go to footnote 270"><span class="small">[270]</span></a> It is nowhere mentioned that he found
it, and Dr. Storm thinks it probable that he perished in the enterprise,
for, within the next year or next but one, the Greenlanders asked for a
new bishop, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span> and Eric's successor, Bishop Arnold, was
consecrated in 1124.<a id="footnotetag271" name="footnotetag271"></a><a href="#footnote271" title="Go to footnote 271"><span class="small">[271]</span></a> After Eric there was a regular succession of
bishops appointed by the papal court, down at least to 1409, and
seventeen of these bishops are mentioned by name. We do not learn that
any of them ever repeated Eric's experiment of searching for Vinland. So
far as existing Icelandic vellums know, there was no voyage to Vinland
after 1121. Very likely, however, there may have been occasional voyages
for timber from Greenland to the coast of the American continent, which
did not attract attention or call for comment in Iceland. This is
rendered somewhat probable from an entry in the "Elder Skálholt Annals,"
<span class="sidenote">The ship from Markland, 1347.</span>
a vellum written about 1362. This informs us that in 1347 "there came a
ship from Greenland, less in size than small Icelandic trading-vessels.
It was without an anchor. There were seventeen men on board, and they
had sailed to Markland, but had afterwards been driven hither by storms
at sea."<a id="footnotetag272" name="footnotetag272"></a><a href="#footnote272" title="Go to footnote 272"><span class="small">[272]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> This is the latest mention of any voyage to or
from the countries beyond Greenland.</p>

<p>If the reader is inclined to wonder why a colony could be maintained in
southern Greenland more easily than on the coasts of Nova Scotia or
Massachusetts, or even why the Northmen did not at once abandon their
fiords at Brattahlid and come in a flock to these pleasanter places, he
must call to mind two important circumstances. First, the settlers in
southern Greenland did not meet with barbarous natives, but only with
vestiges of their former presence. It was not until the twelfth century
that, in roaming the icy deserts of the far north in quest of seals and
bearskins, the Norse hunters encountered tribes of Eskimo using stone
knives and whalebone arrow-heads;<a id="footnotetag273" name="footnotetag273"></a><a href="#footnote273" title="Go to footnote 273"><span class="small">[273]</span></a> and it was not until the
fourteenth century that we hear of their getting into a war with these
people. <span class="sidenote">The Greenland colony attacked by Eskimos.</span>
In 1349 the West Bygd was attacked and destroyed by Eskimos; in
1379 they invaded the East Bygd and wrought sad havoc; and it is
generally believed that some time after 1409 they completed the
destruction of the colony.</p>

<p>Secondly, the relative proximity of Greenland to the mother country,
Iceland, made it much easier to sustain a colony there than in the more
distant Vinland. In colonizing, as in campaigning, distance from one's
base is sometimes the supreme circumstance. This is illustrated by the
fact that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span> the very existence of the Greenland colony itself
depended upon perpetual and untrammelled exchange of commodities with
Iceland; and when once the source of supply was cut off, the colony soon
languished. In 1380 and 1387 the crowns of Norway and Denmark descended
upon Queen Margaret, and soon she made her precious contribution to the
innumerable swarm of instances that show with how little wisdom the
world is ruled. She made the trade to <span class="sidenote">Queen Margaret's monopoly, and its baneful effects.</span>
Greenland, Iceland, and the Færoe
isles "a royal monopoly which could only be carried on in ships
belonging to, or licensed by, the sovereign.... Under the monopoly of
trade the Icelanders could have no vessels, and no object for sailing to
Greenland; and the vessels fitted out by government, or its lessees,
would only be ready to leave Denmark or Bergen for Iceland at the season
they ought to have been ready to leave Iceland to go to Greenland. The
colony gradually fell into oblivion."<a id="footnotetag274" name="footnotetag274"></a><a href="#footnote274" title="Go to footnote 274"><span class="small">[274]</span></a> When this prohibitory
management was abandoned after 1534 by Christian III., it was altogether
too late. Starved by the miserable policy of governmental interference
with freedom of trade, the little Greenland colony soon became too weak
to sustain itself against the natives whose hostility had, for half a
century, been growing more and more dangerous. Precisely when or how
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span> it perished we do not know. The latest notice we have of the
colony is of a marriage ceremony performed (probably in the Kakortok
church), in 1409, by Endrede Andreasson, the last bishop.<a id="footnotetag275" name="footnotetag275"></a><a href="#footnote275" title="Go to footnote 275"><span class="small">[275]</span></a> When,
after three centuries, the great missionary, Hans Egede, visited
Greenland, in 1721, he found the ruins of farmsteads and villages, the
population of which had vanished.</p>

<hr>

<p>Our account of pre-Columbian voyages to America would be very incomplete
without some mention of the latest voyage said to have been made by
European vessels to the ancient settlement of the East Bygd. I refer to
the famous narrative of the Zeno brothers, <span class="sidenote">The story of the Venetian brothers.</span>
which has furnished so many
subjects of contention for geographers that a hundred years ago John
Pinkerton called it "one of the most puzzling in the whole circle of
literature."<a id="footnotetag276" name="footnotetag276"></a><a href="#footnote276" title="Go to footnote 276"><span class="small">[276]</span></a> Nevertheless a great deal has been done, chiefly
through the acute researches of Mr. Richard Henry Major and Baron
Nordenskjöld, toward clearing up this mystery, so that certain points in
the Zeno narrative may now be regarded as established;<a id="footnotetag277" name="footnotetag277"></a><a href="#footnote277" title="Go to footnote 277"><span class="small">[277]</span></a> and from
these essential points we may <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span> form an opinion as to the
character of sundry questionable details.</p>

<p>The Zeno family was one of the oldest and most distinguished in Venice.
<span class="sidenote">The Zeno family.</span>
Among its members in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries we find a
doge, several senators and members of the Council of Ten, and military
commanders of high repute. Of these, Pietro Dracone Zeno, about 1350,
was captain-general of the Christian league for withstanding the Turks;
and his son Carlo achieved such success in the war against Genoa that he
was called the Lion of St. Mark, and his services to Venice were
compared with those of Camillus to Rome. Now this Carlo had two
brothers,&mdash;Nicolò, known as "the Chevalier," and Antonio. After the
close of the Genoese war the Chevalier Nicolò was seized with a desire
to see the world,<a id="footnotetag278" name="footnotetag278"></a><a href="#footnote278" title="Go to footnote 278"><span class="small">[278]</span></a> and more particularly England and Flanders. So
about 1390 he fitted up a ship at his own expense, and, passing out from
the strait of Gibraltar, sailed northward upon the Atlantic.
<span class="sidenote">Nicolò Zeno wrecked upon one of the Færoe islands, 1390.</span>
After some
days of fair weather, he was caught in a storm and blown along for many
days more, until at length the ship was cast ashore on one of the Færoe
islands and wrecked, though most of the crew and goods were rescued.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span> According to the barbarous custom of the Middle Ages, some of
the natives of the island (Scandinavians) came swarming about the
unfortunate strangers to kill and rob them, but a great chieftain, with
a force of knights and men-at-arms, arrived upon the spot in time to
prevent such an outrage. This chief was Henry Sinclair of Roslyn, who in
1379 had been invested by King Hacon VI., of Norway, with the earldom of
the Orkneys and Caithness. On learning Zeno's rank and importance,
Sinclair treated him with much courtesy, and presently a friendship
sprang up between the two. Sinclair was then engaged with a fleet of
thirteen vessels in conquering and annexing to his earldom the Færoe
islands, and on several occasions profited by the military and nautical
skill of the Venetian captain. Nicolò seems to have enjoyed this
stirring life, for he presently sent to his brother Antonio in Venice an
account of it, which induced the latter to come and join him in the
Færoe islands. Antonio arrived in the course of 1391, and remained in
the service of Sinclair fourteen years, returning to Venice in time to
die there in 1406. After Antonio's arrival, his brother Nicolò was
appointed to the chief command of Sinclair's little fleet, and assisted
him in taking possession of the Shetland islands, which were properly
comprised within his earldom. In the course of these adventures, Nicolò
seems to have had his interest aroused in reports about Greenland. It
was not more than four or five years since Queen Margaret had undertaken
to make a royal monopoly of the Greenland trade in furs and whale oil,
and this would <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> be a natural topic of conversation in the
Færoes. In July, 1393, or 1394, Nicolò Zeno sailed to Greenland with
three ships, and visited the East Bygd.
<span class="sidenote">Nicolò's voyage to Greenland, cir. 1394.</span>
After spending some time there,
not being accustomed to such a climate, he caught cold, and died soon
after his return to the Færoes, probably in 1395. His brother Antonio
succeeded to his office and such emoluments as pertained to it; and
after a while, at Earl Sinclair's instigation, he undertook a voyage of
discovery in the Atlantic ocean, in order to verify some fishermen's
reports of the existence of land a thousand miles or more to the west.
One of these fishermen was to serve as guide to the expedition, but
unfortunately he died three days before the ships were ready to sail.
Nevertheless, the expedition started,
<span class="sidenote">Voyage of Earl Sinclair and Antonio Zeno.</span>
with Sinclair himself on board,
and encountered vicissitudes of weather and fortune. In fog and storm
they lost all reckoning of position, and found themselves at length on
the western coast of a country which, in the Italian narrative, is
called "Icaria," but which has been supposed, with some probability, to
have been Kerry, in Ireland. Here, as they went ashore for fresh water,
they were attacked by the natives and several of their number were
slain. From this point they sailed out into the broad Atlantic again,
and reached a place supposed to be Greenland, but which is so vaguely
described that the identification is very difficult.<a id="footnotetag279" name="footnotetag279"></a><a href="#footnote279" title="Go to footnote 279"><span class="small">[279]</span></a> Our narrative
here ends <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span> somewhat confusedly. We are told that Sinclair
remained in this place, "and explored the whole of the country with
great diligence, as well as the coasts on both sides of Greenland."
Antonio Zeno, on the other hand, returned with part of the fleet to the
Færoe islands, where he arrived after sailing eastward for about a
month, during five and twenty days of which he saw no land. After
relating these things and paying a word of affectionate tribute to the
virtues of Earl Sinclair, "a prince as worthy of immortal memory as any
that ever lived for his great bravery and remarkable goodness," Antonio
closes his letter abruptly: "But of this I will say no more in this
letter, and hope to be with you very shortly, and to satisfy your
curiosity on other subjects by word of mouth."<a id="footnotetag280" name="footnotetag280"></a><a href="#footnote280" title="Go to footnote 280"><span class="small">[280]</span></a></p>

<p>The person thus addressed by Antonio was his brother, the illustrious
Carlo Zeno. Soon after reaching home, after this long and eventful
absence, Antonio died. Besides his letters he had written a more
detailed account of the affairs in the northern seas. These papers
remained for more than a century in the palace of the family at Venice,
until one of the children, in his mischievous play, got hold of them and
tore them up. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span> This child was Antonio's
great-great-great-grandson, Nicolò, born in 1515. When this young Nicolò
had come to middle age, and was a member of the Council of Ten, he
happened to come across some remnants of these documents, and then all
at once he remembered with grief how he had, in his boyhood, pulled them
to pieces.<a id="footnotetag281" name="footnotetag281"></a><a href="#footnote281" title="Go to footnote 281"><span class="small">[281]</span></a> In the light of the rapid progress in geographical
discovery since 1492, <span class="sidenote">Publication of the remains of the documents by the younger
Nicolò Zeno.</span>
this story of distant voyages had now for Nicolò
an interest such as it could not have had for his immediate ancestors.
Searching the palace he found a few grimy old letters and a map or
sailing chart, rotten with age, which had been made or at any rate
brought home by his ancestor Antonio. Nicolò drew a fresh copy of this
map, and pieced together the letters as best he could, with more or less
explanatory text of his own, and the result was the little book which he
published in 1558.<a id="footnotetag282" name="footnotetag282"></a><a href="#footnote282" title="Go to footnote 282"><span class="small">[282]</span></a></p>

<p>Zeno Map, cir. 1400&mdash;western half &amp; eastern half.</p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately young Nicolò, with the laudable purpose of making it all
as clear as he could, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> thought it necessary not simply to
reproduce the old weather-beaten map, but to amend it by putting on here
and there such places and names as his diligent perusal of the
manuscript led him to deem wanting to its completeness.<a id="footnotetag283" name="footnotetag283"></a><a href="#footnote283" title="Go to footnote 283"><span class="small">[283]</span></a> Under the
most favourable circumstances that is a very difficult sort of thing to
do, but in this case the circumstances were far from favourable. Of
course Nicolò got these names and places into absurd <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span>
positions, thus perplexing the map and damaging its reputation. With
regard to names, there was obscurity enough, to begin with. In the first
place, they were Icelandic names falling upon the Italian ears of old
Nicolò and Antonio, <span class="sidenote">Queer transformations of names.</span>
and spelled by them according to their own notions;
in the second place, these outlandish names, blurred and defaced withal
in the weather-stained manuscript, were a puzzle to the eye of young
Nicolò, who could but decipher them according to <i>his</i> notions. The
havoc that can be wrought upon winged words, subjected to such
processes, is sometimes marvellous.<a id="footnotetag284" name="footnotetag284"></a><a href="#footnote284" title="Go to footnote 284"><span class="small">[284]</span></a> Perhaps the slightest sufferer,
in this case, was the name of the group of islands upon one of which the
shipwrecked Nicolò was rescued by Sinclair. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span> name
<i>Færoislander</i> sounded to Italian ears as <i>Frislanda</i>, and was uniformly
so written.<a id="footnotetag285" name="footnotetag285"></a><a href="#footnote285" title="Go to footnote 285"><span class="small">[285]</span></a> Then the pronunciation of <i>Shetland</i> was helped by
prefixing a vowel sound, as is common in Italian, and so it came to be
<i>Estland</i> and <i>Esland</i>. This led young Nicolò's eye in two or three
places to confound it with <i>Islanda</i>, or <i>Iceland</i>, and probably in one
place with <i>Irlanda</i>, or <i>Ireland</i>. Where old Nicolò meant to say that
the island upon which he was living with Earl Sinclair was somewhat
larger than Shetland, young Nicolò understood him as saying that it was
somewhat larger than Ireland; <span class="sidenote">"Frislanda."</span>
and so upon the amended map "Frislanda"
appears as one great island surrounded by tiny islands.<a id="footnotetag286" name="footnotetag286"></a><a href="#footnote286" title="Go to footnote 286"><span class="small">[286]</span></a> After the
publication of this map, in 1558, sundry details were copied from it by
the new maps of that day, so that even far down into the seventeenth
century it was common to depict a big "Frislanda" somewhere in
mid-ocean. When at length it was proved that no such island exists, the
reputation of the Zeno narrative was seriously damaged. The nadir of
reaction against it was reached when it was declared to be a tissue of
lies invented by the younger Nicolò,<a id="footnotetag287" name="footnotetag287"></a><a href="#footnote287" title="Go to footnote 287"><span class="small">[287]</span></a> apparently for the purpose of
setting up a Venetian claim to the discovery of America.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span>

<p>The narrative, however, not only sets up no such claim, but nowhere
betrays a consciousness that its incidents entitle it to make such a
claim. <span class="sidenote">The narrative nowhere makes a claim to the
"discovery of America."</span>
It had evidently not occurred to young Nicolò to institute any
comparison between his ancestors' voyages to Greenland and the voyages
of Columbus to the western hemisphere, of which <i>we now know</i> Greenland
to be a part. The knowledge of the North American coast, and of the
bearing of one fact upon another fact in relation to it, was still, in
1558, in an extremely vague and rudimentary condition. In the mind of
the Zeno brothers, as the map shows, Greenland was a European peninsula;
such was the idea common among mediæval Northmen, as is nowhere better
illustrated than in this map. Neither in his references to Greenland,
nor to Estotiland and Drogio, presently to be considered, does young
Nicolò appear in the light of a man urging or suggesting a "claim." He
appears simply as a modest and conscientious editor, interested in the
deeds of his ancestors and impressed with the fact that he has got hold
of important documents, but intent only upon giving his material as
correctly as possible, and refraining from all sort of comment except
such as now <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> and then seems needful to explain the text as he
himself understands it.</p>

<p>The identification of "Frislanda" with the Færoe islands was put beyond
doubt by the discovery that the "Zichmni" of the narrative means Henry
Sinclair; <span class="sidenote">Earl Sinclair.</span>
and, in order to make this discovery, it was only necessary to
know something about the history of the Orkneys; hence old Pinkerton, as
above remarked, got it right. The name "Zichmni" is, no doubt, a fearful
and wonderful bejugglement; but Henry Sinclair is a personage well known
to history in that corner of the world, and the deeds of "Zichmni," as
recounted in the narrative, are neither more nor less than the deeds of
Sinclair. Doubtless Antonio spelled the name in some queer way of his
own, and then young Nicolò, unable to read his ancestor's pot-hooks
where&mdash;as in the case of proper names&mdash;there was no clue to guide him,
contrived to make it still queerer. Here we have strong proof of the
genuineness of the narrative. If Nicolò had been concocting a story in
which Earl Sinclair was made to figure, he would have obtained his
knowledge from literary sources, and thus would have got his names
right; the earl might have appeared as Enrico de Santo Claro, but not as
"Zichmni." It is not at all likely, however, that any literary knowledge
of Sinclair and his doings was obtainable in Italy in the sixteenth
century. The Zeno narrative, moreover, in its references to Greenland in
connection with the Chevalier Nicolò's visit to the East Bygd, shows a
topographical knowledge that was otherwise <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> quite inaccessible
to the younger Nicolò. Late in the fourteenth century Ivar Bardsen,
steward to the Gardar bishopric, wrote a description of
<span class="sidenote">Bardsen's "Description of Greenland."</span>
Greenland, with
sailing directions for reaching it, which modern research has proved to
have been accurate in every particular. Bardsen's details and those of
the Zeno narrative mutually corroborate each other. But Bardsen's book
did not make its way down into Europe until the very end of the
sixteenth century,<a id="footnotetag288" name="footnotetag288"></a><a href="#footnote288" title="Go to footnote 288"><span class="small">[288]</span></a> and then amid the dense ignorance prevalent
concerning Greenland its details were not understood until actual
exploration within the last seventy years has at length revealed their
meaning. The genuineness of the Zeno narrative is thus conclusively
proved by its knowledge of Arctic geography, such as could have been
obtained only by a visit to the far North at a time before the Greenland
colony had finally lost touch with its mother country.</p>

<p>The visit of the Chevalier Nicolò, therefore, about 1394, has a peculiar
interest as the last distinct glimpse afforded us of the colony founded
by Eric the Red before its melancholy disappearance from history.
Already the West Bygd had ceased to exist. Five and forty years before
that time it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> had been laid waste and its people massacred by
Eskimos, and trusty Ivar Bardsen, tardily sent with a small force to the
rescue, found nothing left alive but a few cattle and sheep running
wild.<a id="footnotetag289" name="footnotetag289"></a><a href="#footnote289" title="Go to footnote 289"><span class="small">[289]</span></a>
Nicolò Zeno, arriving in the
<span class="sidenote">The monastery of St. Olaus and its hot spring.</span>
East Bygd, found there a
monastery dedicated to St. Olaus, a name which in the narrative has
become St. Thomas. To this monastery came friars from Norway and other
countries, but for the most part from Iceland.<a id="footnotetag290" name="footnotetag290"></a><a href="#footnote290" title="Go to footnote 290"><span class="small">[290]</span></a> It stood "hard by a
hill which vomited fire like Vesuvius and Etna." There was also in the
neighbourhood a spring of hot water which the ingenious friars conducted
in pipes into their monastery and church, thereby keeping themselves
comfortable in the coldest weather. This water, as it came into the
kitchen, was hot enough to boil meats and vegetables. The monks even
made use of it in warming covered gardens or hot-beds in which they
raised sundry fruits and herbs that in milder climates grow out of
doors.<a id="footnotetag291" name="footnotetag291"></a><a href="#footnote291" title="Go to footnote 291"><span class="small">[291]</span></a> "Hither in summertime <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span> come many vessels from ...
the Cape above Norway, and from Trondheim, and bring the friars all
sorts of comforts, taking in exchange fish ... and skins of different
kinds of animals.... There are continually in the harbour a number of
vessels detained by the sea being frozen, and waiting for the next
season to melt the ice."<a id="footnotetag292" name="footnotetag292"></a><a href="#footnote292" title="Go to footnote 292"><span class="small">[292]</span></a></p>

<p>This mention of the volcano and the hot spring is very interesting. In
the Miocene period the Atlantic <span class="sidenote">Volcanoes of the north Atlantic ridge.</span>
ridge was one of the principal seats of
volcanic activity upon the globe; the line of volcanoes extended all the
way from Greenland down into central France. But for several hundred
thousand years this activity has been diminishing. In France, in the
western parts of Great Britain and the Hebrides, the craters have long
since become extinct. In the far North, however, volcanic action has
been slower in dying out. Iceland, with no less than twenty active
volcanoes, is still the most considerable centre of such operations in
Europe. The huge volcano on Jan Mayen island, between Greenland and
Spitzbergen, is still in action. Among the submerged peaks in the
northern seas explosions still now and then occur, as in 1783, when a
small island was thrown up near Cape Reykianes, on the southern coast of
Iceland, and sank again after a year.<a id="footnotetag293" name="footnotetag293"></a><a href="#footnote293" title="Go to footnote 293"><span class="small">[293]</span></a> Midway between Iceland and
Greenland there appears to have stood, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> in the Middle Ages, a
small volcanic island discovered by that Gunnbjörn who first went to
Greenland. It was known as <span class="sidenote">Fate of Gunnbjörn's Skerries, 1456.</span>
Gunnbjörn's Skerries, and was described by
Ivar Bardsen.<a id="footnotetag294" name="footnotetag294"></a><a href="#footnote294" title="Go to footnote 294"><span class="small">[294]</span></a> This island is no longer above the surface, and its
fate is recorded upon Ruysch's map of the world in the 1508 edition of
Ptolemy: "Insula hæc anno Domini 1456 fuit totaliter combusta,"&mdash;this
island was entirely burnt (i. e. blown up in an eruption) in 1456; and
in later maps Mr. Major has found the corrupted name "Gombar Scheer"
applied to the dangerous reefs and shoals left behind by this
explosion.<a id="footnotetag295" name="footnotetag295"></a><a href="#footnote295" title="Go to footnote 295"><span class="small">[295]</span></a> Where volcanic action is declining geysers and boiling
springs are apt to abound, as in Iceland; where it has become extinct at
a period geologically recent, as in Auvergne and the Rhine country, its
latest vestiges are left in the hundreds of thermal and mineral springs
whither fashionable invalids congregate to drink or to bathe.<a id="footnotetag296" name="footnotetag296"></a><a href="#footnote296" title="Go to footnote 296"><span class="small">[296]</span></a> Now
in <span class="sidenote">Volcanic phenomena in Greenland.</span>
Greenland, at the present day, hot springs are found, of which the
most noted are those on the island of Ounartok, at the entrance to the
fiord of that name. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span> These springs seem to be the same that
were described five hundred years ago by Ivar Bardsen. As to volcanoes,
it has been generally assumed that those of Greenland are all extinct;
but in a country as yet so imperfectly studied this only means that
eruptions have not been recorded.<a id="footnotetag297" name="footnotetag297"></a><a href="#footnote297" title="Go to footnote 297"><span class="small">[297]</span></a> On the whole, it seems to me that
the mention, in our Venetian narrative, of a boiling spring and an
active volcano in Greenland is an instance of the peculiar sort&mdash;too
strange to have been invented, but altogether probable in itself&mdash;that
adds to the credit of the narrative.</p>

<p>Thus far, in dealing with the places actually visited by Nicolò or
Antonio, or by both brothers, we have found the story consistent and
intelligible. But in what relates to countries beyond Greenland,
countries which were not visited by either of the brothers, but about
which Antonio heard reports, it is quite a different thing. We are
introduced to a jumble very unlike the clear, business-like account of
Vinland voyages in the Hauks-bók. Yet in this medley there are some
statements curiously suggestive of things in North America. It will be
remembered that Antonio's voyage with Sinclair (somewhere about 1400)
was undertaken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> in order to verify certain reports of the
existence of land more than a thousand miles west of the Færoe islands.</p>

<p>About six and twenty years ago, said Antonio in a letter to Carlo, four
small fishing craft, venturing very far out upon the Atlantic, had been
blown upon a strange coast, where their crews were well received by the
people. The land proved to be an island rather smaller than <span class="sidenote">Estotiland.</span>
Iceland (or
Shetland?), with a high mountain whence flowed four rivers. The
inhabitants were intelligent people, possessed of all the arts, but did
not understand the language of these Norse fishermen.<a id="footnotetag298" name="footnotetag298"></a><a href="#footnote298" title="Go to footnote 298"><span class="small">[298]</span></a> There
happened, however, to be one European among them, who had himself been
cast ashore in that country and had learned its language; he could speak
Latin, and found some one among the shipwrecked men who could understand
him. There was a populous city with walls, and the king had Latin books
in his library which nobody could read.<a id="footnotetag299" name="footnotetag299"></a><a href="#footnote299" title="Go to footnote 299"><span class="small">[299]</span></a> All kinds of metals
abounded, and especially gold.<a id="footnotetag300" name="footnotetag300"></a><a href="#footnote300" title="Go to footnote 300"><span class="small">[300]</span></a> The woods were of immense extent.
The people traded with Greenland, importing thence pitch(?), brimstone,
and furs. They sowed grain and made "beer." They made small boats, but
were ignorant of the loadstone and the compass. For this reason, they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span> held the newcomers in high estimation.<a id="footnotetag301" name="footnotetag301"></a><a href="#footnote301" title="Go to footnote 301"><span class="small">[301]</span></a> The name of the
country was Estotiland.</p>

<p>There is nothing so far in this vague description to show that
Estotiland was an American country, except its western direction and
perhaps its trading with Greenland. The points of unlikeness are at
least as numerous as the points of likeness. But in what follows there
is a much stronger suggestion of North America.</p>

<p>For some reason not specified an expedition was undertaken by people
from Estotiland to a country to the southward named <span class="sidenote">Drogio.</span>
Drogio, and these
Norse mariners, or some of them, because they understood the compass,
were put in charge of it.<a id="footnotetag302" name="footnotetag302"></a><a href="#footnote302" title="Go to footnote 302"><span class="small">[302]</span></a> But the people of Drogio were cannibals,
and the people from Estotiland on their arrival were taken prisoners and
devoured,&mdash;all save the few Northmen, who were saved because of their
marvellous skill in catching fish with nets. The barbarians seemed to
have set much store by these white men, and perhaps to have regarded
them as objects of "medicine." One of the fishermen in particular became
so famous that a neighbouring tribe made war upon the tribe which kept
him, and winning the victory took him over into its own custody. This
sort of thing happened several times. Various tribes fought to secure
the person and services of this Fisherman, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> so that he was
passed about among more than twenty chiefs, and "wandering up and down
the country without any fixed abode, ... he became acquainted with all
those parts."</p>

<p>And now comes quite an interesting passage. The Fisherman "says that it
is a very great country, and, as it were, a new world; the <span class="sidenote">Inhabitants of Drogio and the countries beyond.</span>
people are
very rude and uncultivated, for they all go naked, and suffer cruelly
from the cold, nor have they the sense to clothe themselves with the
skins of the animals which they take in hunting [a gross exaggeration].
They have no kind of metal. They live by hunting, and carry lances of
wood, sharpened at the point. They have bows, the strings of which are
made of beasts' skins. They are very fierce, and have deadly fights
amongst each other, and eat one another's flesh. They have chieftains
and certain laws among themselves, but differing in the different
tribes. The farther you go southwestwards, however, the more refinement
you meet with, because the climate is more temperate, and accordingly
there they have cities and temples dedicated to their idols, in which
they sacrifice men and afterwards eat them. In those parts they have
some knowledge and use of gold and silver. Now this Fisherman, having
dwelt so many years in these parts, made up his mind, if possible, to
return home to his own country; but his companions, despairing of ever
seeing it again, gave him God's speed, and remained themselves where
they were. Accordingly, he bade them farewell, and made his escape
through the woods in the direction of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span> Drogio, where he was
welcomed and very kindly received by the chief of the place, who knew
him, and was a great enemy of the neighbouring chieftain; and so passing
from one chief to another, being the same with whom he had been before,
after a long time and with much toil, he at length reached Drogio, where
he spent three years. Here, by good luck, he heard from the natives that
some boats had arrived off the coast; and full of hope of being able to
carry out his intention, he went down to the seaside, and to his great
delight found that they had come from Estotiland. He forthwith requested
that they would take him with them, which they did very willingly, and
as he knew the language of the country, which none of them could speak,
they employed him as their interpreter."<a id="footnotetag303" name="footnotetag303"></a><a href="#footnote303" title="Go to footnote 303"><span class="small">[303]</span></a></p>


<p>Whither the Fisherman was first carried in these boats or vessels,
Antonio's letter does not inform us. We are only told that he engaged in
some prosperous voyages, and at length returned to the <span class="sidenote">The Fisherman's return to "Frislanda."</span>
Færoes after
these six and twenty years of strange adventures. It was apparently the
Fisherman's description of Estotiland as a very rich country (<i>paese
ricchissimo</i>) that led Sinclair to fit out an expedition to visit it,
with Antonio as his chief captain. As we have already seen, the
Fisherman died just before the ships were ready to start, and to
whatever land they succeeded in reaching after they sailed without him,
the narrative leaves us with the impression that it was not the
mysterious Estotiland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> To attempt to identify that country from the description of it,
which reads like a parcel of ill-digested sailors' yarns, would be idle.
The most common conjecture has identified it with Newfoundland, from its
relations to other points mentioned in the Zeno narrative, as indicated,
with fair probability, on the Zeno map. To identify it with Newfoundland
is to brand the description as a "fish story," but from such a
conclusion there seems anyway to be no escape.</p>


<p>With Drogio, however, it is otherwise. The description of <span class="sidenote">Was the account of Drogio woven into the narrative by the
younger Nicolò?</span>
Drogio and the
vast country stretching beyond it, which was like a "new world," is the
merest sketch, but it seems to contain enough characteristic details to
stamp it as a description of North America, and of no other country
accessible by an Atlantic voyage. It is a sketch which apparently must
have had its ultimate source in somebody's personal experience of
aboriginal North America. Here we are reminded that when the younger
Nicolò published this narrative, in 1558, some dim knowledge of the
North American tribes was beginning to make its way into the minds of
people in Europe. The work of Soto and Cartier, to say nothing of other
explorers, had already been done. May we suppose that Nicolò had thus
obtained some idea of North America, and wove it into his reproduction
of his ancestors' letters, for the sake of completeness and point, in
somewhat the same uncritical mood as that in which the most worthy
ancient historians did not scruple to invent speeches to put into the
mouths of their heroes? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span> It may have been so, and in such case
the description of Drogio loses its point for us as a feature in the
pre-Columbian voyages to America. In such case we may dismiss it at
once, and pretty much all the latter part of the Zeno narrative,
relating to what Antonio heard and did, becomes valueless; though the
earlier part, relating to the elder Nicolò, still remains valid and
trustworthy.</p>

<p>But suppose we take the other alternative. As in the earlier part of the
story we feel sure that young Nicolò must have reproduced the ancestral
documents faithfully, because it shows knowledge that he could not have
got in any other way; let us now suppose that in the latter part also he
added nothing of himself, but was simply a faithful editor.
<span class="sidenote">Or does it represent actual experiences in North America?</span>
It will then
follow that the Fisherman's account of Drogio, reduced to writing by
Antonio Zeno about 1400, must probably represent personal experiences in
North America; for no such happy combination of details characteristic
only of North America is likely at that date to have been invented
by any European. Our simplest course will be to suppose that the
Fisherman really had the experiences which are narrated, that he was
bandied about from tribe to tribe in North America, all the way,
perhaps, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and yet returned to the Færoe
islands to tell the tale! Could such a thing be possible? Was anything
of the sort ever done before or since?</p>

<p>Yes: something of the sort appears to have been done about ten years
after the Zeno narrative was published. In October, 1568, that great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> sailor, Sir John Hawkins, by reason of scarcity of food,
<span class="sidenote">The case of David Ingram, 1568.</span>
was
compelled to set about a hundred men ashore near the Rio de Minas, on
the Mexican coast, and leave them to their fate. The continent was a
network of rude paths or trails, as it had doubtless been for ages, and
as central Africa is to-day. Most of these Englishmen probably perished
in the wilderness. Some who took southwestern trails found their way to
the city of Mexico, where, as "vile Lutheran dogges," they were treated
with anything but kindness. Others took northeasterly trails, and one of
these men, David Ingram, made his way from Texas to Maine, and beyond to
the St. John's river, where he was picked up by a friendly French ship
and carried to France, and so got home to England. The journey across
North America took him about eleven months, but one of his comrades, Job
Hortop, had no end of adventures, and was more than twenty years in
getting back to England. Ingram told such blessed yarns about houses of
crystal and silver, and other wonderful things, that many disbelieved
his whole story, but he was subjected to a searching examination before
Sir Francis Walsingham, and as to the main fact of his journey through
the wilderness there seems to be no doubt.<a id="footnotetag304" name="footnotetag304"></a><a href="#footnote304" title="Go to footnote 304"><span class="small">[304]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span>

<p>Far more important, historically, and in many ways more instructive than
the wanderings of David Ingram, was the journey of <span class="sidenote">The case of Cabeza de Vaca, 1528-36.</span>
Cabeza de Vaca and
his ingenious comrades, in 1528-36, from the Mississippi river to their
friends in Mexico. This remarkable journey will receive further
consideration in another place.<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a><a href="#footnote305" title="Go to footnote 305"><span class="small">[305]</span></a> In the course of it Cabeza de Vaca
was for eight years held captive by sundry Indian tribes, and at last
his escape involved ten months of arduous travel. On one occasion he and
his friends treated some sick Indians, among other things breathing upon
them and making the sign of the cross. As the Indians happened to get
well, these Spaniards at once became objects of reverence, and different
tribes vied with one another for access to them, in order to benefit by
their supernatural gifts. In those early days, before the red men had
become used to seeing Europeans, a white captive was not so likely to be
put to death as to be cherished as a helper of vast and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span>
undetermined value.<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a><a href="#footnote306" title="Go to footnote 306"><span class="small">[306]</span></a> The Indians set so much store by Cabeza de Vaca
that he found it hard to tear himself away; but at length he used his
influence over them in such wise as to facilitate his moving in a
direction by which he ultimately succeeded in escaping to his friends.
There seems to be a real analogy between his strange experiences and
those of the Fisherman in Drogio, who became an object of reverence
because he could do things that the natives could not do, yet the value
of which they were able to appreciate.</p>

<p>Now if the younger Nicolò had been in the mood for adorning his
ancestors' narrative by inserting a few picturesque incidents out of his
own hearsay knowledge of North America, it does not seem likely that he
would have known enough to hit so deftly upon one of the peculiarities
of the barbaric mind. Here, again, we seem to have come upon one of
those incidents, inherently probable, but too strange to have been
invented, that tend to confirm the story. Without hazarding anything
like a positive opinion, it seems to me likely enough that this voyage
of Scandinavian fishermen to the coast of North America in the
fourteenth century may have happened.</p>


<p>It was this and other unrecorded but possible
<span class="sidenote">There may have been unrecorded instances of visits to North
America.</span>
instances that I had in
mind at the beginning of this chapter, in saying that occasional visits
of Europeans to America in pre-Columbian times may have occurred oftener
than we are wont to suppose. Observe <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> that our scanty
records&mdash;naturally somewhat perplexed and dim, as treating of remote and
unknown places&mdash;refer us to that northern Atlantic region where the
ocean is comparatively narrow, and to that northern people who, from the
time of their first appearance in history, have been as much at home
upon sea as upon land. For a thousand years past these hyperborean
waters have been furrowed in many directions by stout Scandinavian
keels, and if, in aiming at Greenland, the gallant mariners may now and
then have hit upon Labrador or Newfoundland, and have made flying visits
to coasts still farther southward, there is nothing in it all which need
surprise us.<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a><a href="#footnote307" title="Go to footnote 307"><span class="small">[307]</span></a></p>

<hr>

<p>Nothing can be clearer, however, from a survey of the whole subject,
than that these <span class="sidenote">The pre-Columbian voyages made no real contributions to
geographical knowledge;</span>
pre-Columbian voyages were quite barren of results of
historic importance. In point of colonization they produced the two
ill-fated settlements on the Greenland coast, and nothing more.
Otherwise they made no real addition to the stock of geographical
knowledge, they wrought no effect whatever upon the European mind
outside of Scandinavia, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> and even in Iceland itself the mention
of coasts beyond Greenland awakened no definite ideas, and, except for a
brief season, excited no interest. The Zeno narrative indicates that the
Vinland voyages had practically lapsed from memory before the end of the
fourteenth century.<a id="footnotetag308" name="footnotetag308"></a><a href="#footnote308" title="Go to footnote 308"><span class="small">[308]</span></a> Scholars familiar with saga literature of
course knew the story; it was just at this time that Jón Thórdharson
wrote out the version of it which is preserved in the Flateyar-bók. But
by the general public it must have been forgotten, or else the
Fisherman's tale of Estotiland and Drogio would surely have awakened
reminiscences of Markland and Vinland, and some traces of this would
have appeared in Antonio's narrative or upon his map. The principal
naval officer of the Færoes, and personal friend of the sovereign, after
dwelling several years among these Northmen, whose intercourse with
their brethren in Iceland was frequent, apparently knew nothing of Leif
or Thorfinn, or the mere names of the coasts which they had visited.
<span class="sidenote">and were in no true sense a Discovery of America.</span>
Nothing had been accomplished by those voyages which could properly be
called a contribution to geographical knowledge. To speak of them as
constituting, in any legitimate sense of the phrase, a Discovery of
America is simply absurd. Except for Greenland, which was supposed to be
a part of the European world, America remained as much undiscovered
after the eleventh century as before. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> In the midsummer of 1492
it needed to be discovered as much as if Leif Ericsson or the whole race
of Northmen had never existed.</p>

<p>As these pre-Columbian voyages produced no effect in the eastern
hemisphere, except to leave in Icelandic literature a scanty but
interesting record, so in the western hemisphere they seem to have
produced no effect beyond cutting down a few trees and killing a few
Indians. In the outlying world of Greenland it is not improbable that
the blood of the Eskimos may have received some slight Scandinavian
infusion. But upon the aboriginal world of the red men, from Davis
strait to Cape Horn, it is not likely that any impression of any sort
was ever made. It is in the highest degree probable that Leif Ericsson
and his friends made a few voyages to <i>what we now know to have been</i>
the coast of America; but it is an abuse of language to say that they
"discovered" America. In no sense was any real contact established
between the eastern and the western halves of our planet until the great
voyage of Columbus in 1492.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<p>The question has sometimes been asked, Why did the knowledge of the
voyages to Vinland so long remain confined to the Scandinavian people or
a portion of them, and then lapse into oblivion, insomuch that it did
not become a matter of notoriety in Europe until after the publication
of the celebrated book of <span class="sidenote">Why the voyages of the Northmen were not followed up.</span>
Thormodus Torfæus in 1705? Why did not the
news of the voyages of Leif and Thorfinn spread rapidly over Europe,
like the news of the voyage of Columbus? and why was it not presently
followed, like the latter, by a rush of conquerors and colonizers across
the Atlantic?</p>

<p>Such questions arise from a failure to see historical events in their
true perspective, and to make the proper allowances for the manifold
differences in knowledge and in social and economic conditions which
characterize different periods of history. In the present case, the
answer is to be found, first, in the geographical ignorance which
prevented the Northmen from realizing in the smallest degree what such
voyages really signified or were going to signify to posterity; and,
secondly, in the political and commercial condition of Europe at the
close of the tenth century.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span>

<p>In the first place the route which the Norse voyagers pursued, from
Iceland to Greenland and thence to Vinland, was not such as to give
them, in their ignorance of the shape of the earth, and with their
imperfect knowledge of latitude and longitude, any adequate gauge
wherewith to measure their achievement. <span class="sidenote">Ignorance of geography.</span>
The modern reader, who has in
his mind a general picture of the shape of the northern Atlantic ocean
with its coasts, must carefully expel that picture before he can begin
to realize how things must have seemed to the Northmen. None of the
Icelandic references to Markland and Vinland betray a consciousness that
these countries belong to a geographical world outside of Europe. There
was not enough organized geographical knowledge for that. They were
simply conceived as remote places beyond Greenland, inhabited by
inferior but dangerous people. The accidental finding of such places
served neither to solve any great commercial problem nor to gratify and
provoke scientific curiosity. It was, therefore, not at all strange that
it bore no fruit.</p>

<p>Secondly, even if it had been realized, and could have been duly
proclaimed throughout Europe, that across the broad Atlantic a new world
lay open for colonization, Europe could not have taken advantage of the
fact. Now and then a ship might make its way, or be blown,
<span class="sidenote">Lack of instruments for ocean navigation.</span>
across the
waste of waters without compass or astrolabe; but until these
instruments were at hand anything like systematic ocean navigation was
out of the question; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span> from a colonization which could only
begin by creeping up into the Arctic seas and taking Greenland on the
way, not much was to be expected, after all.</p>

<p>But even if the compass and other facilities for oceanic navigation had
been at hand, the state of Europe in the days of Eric the Red was not
such as to afford surplus energy for distant enterprise of this sort.
Let us for a moment recall what was going on in Europe in the year of
grace 1000, just enough to get a suggestive picture of the time. In
England the Danish invader, fork-bearded Swend, father of the great
Cnut, was wresting the kingship from the feeble grasp of Ethelred the
Redeless. <span class="sidenote">Europe in the year 1000.</span>
In Gaul the little duchy of France, between the Somme and the
Loire, had lately become the kingdom of France, and its sovereign, Hugh
Capet, had succeeded to feudal rights of lordship over the great dukes
and counts whose territories surrounded him on every side; and now
Hugh's son, Robert the Debonair, better hymn-writer than warrior, was
waging a doubtful struggle with these unruly vassals. It was not yet in
any wise apparent what the kingdoms of England and France were going to
be. In Germany the youthful Otto III., the "wonder of the world," had
just made his weird visit to the tomb of his mighty predecessor at
Aachen, before starting on that last journey to Rome which was so soon
to cost him his life. Otto's teacher, Gerbert, most erudite of
popes,&mdash;too learned not to have had dealings with the Devil,&mdash;was
beginning to raise the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> papacy out of the abyss of infamy into
which the preceding age had seen it sink, and so to prepare the way for
the far-reaching reforms of Hildebrand. The boundaries of Christendom
were as yet narrow and insecure. With the overthrow of Olaf Tryggvesson
in this year 1000, and the temporary partition of Norway between Swedes
and Danes, the work of Christianizing the North seemed, for the moment,
to languish. Upon the eastern frontier the wild Hungarians had scarcely
ceased to be a terror to Europe, and in this year Stephen, their first
Christian king, began to reign. At the same time the power of heretical
Bulgaria, which had threatened to overwhelm the Eastern Empire, was
broken down by the sturdy blows of the Macedonian emperor Basil. In this
year the Christians of Spain met woful defeat at the hands of Almansor,
and there seemed no reason why the Mussulman rule over the greater part
of that peninsula should not endure forever.</p>

<p>Thus, from end to end, Europe was a scene of direst confusion, and
though, as we now look back upon it, the time seems by no means devoid
of promise, there was no such cheering outlook then. Nowhere were the
outlines of kingdoms or the ownership of crowns definitely settled.
Private war was both incessant and universal; the Truce of God had not
yet been proclaimed.<a id="footnotetag309" name="footnotetag309"></a><a href="#footnote309" title="Go to footnote 309"><span class="small">[309]</span></a> As for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> common people, their
hardships were well-nigh incredible. Amid all this anarchy and misery,
at the close of the thousandth year from the birth of Christ, the belief
was quite common throughout Europe that the Day of Judgment was at hand
for a world grown old in wickedness and ripe for its doom.</p>

<p>It hardly need be argued that a period like this, in which all the vital
energy in Europe was consumed in the adjustment of affairs at home, was
not fitted for colonial enterprises. Before a people can send forth
colonies it must have solved the problem of political life so far as to
ensure stability of trade. <span class="sidenote">The condition of things was not such as to favour colonial
enterprise.</span>
It is the mercantile spirit that has
supported modern colonization, aided by the spirit of intellectual
curiosity and the thirst for romantic adventure. In the eleventh century
there was no intellectual curiosity outside the monastery walls, nor had
such a feeling become enlisted in the service of commerce. Of trade
there was indeed, even in western Europe, a considerable amount, but the
commercial marine was in its infancy, and on land the trader suffered
sorely at the hands of the robber baron. In those days the fashionable
method of compounding with your creditors was, not to offer them fifty
cents on the dollar, but to inveigle them into your castle and broil
them over a slow fire.</p>

<p>In so far as the attention of people in Europe <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> was called to
any quarter of the globe outside of the seething turbulence in which
they dwelt, it was directed toward Asia. Until after 1492, Europe stood
with her back toward the Atlantic. What there might be out beyond that
"Sea of Darkness" (<i>Mare Tenebrosum</i>), as it used commonly to be called,
was a question of little interest and seems to have excited no
speculation. <span class="sidenote">The outlook of Europe was toward Asia.</span>
In the view of mediæval Europe the inhabited world was cut
off on the west by this mysterious ocean, and on the south by the
burning sands of Sahara; but eastward it stretched out no one knew how
far, and in that direction dwelt tribes and nations which Europe, from
time immemorial, had reason to fear. As early as the time of Herodotus,
the secular antagonism between Europe and Asia had become a topic of
reflection among the Greeks, and was wrought with dramatic effect by
that great writer into the structure of his history, culminating in the
grand and stirring scenes of the Persian war. A century and a half later
the conquests of Alexander the Great added a still more impressive
climax to the story. The struggle was afterward long maintained between
Roman and Parthian, but from the fifth century after Christ onward
through the Middle Ages, it seemed as if the Oriental world would never
rest until it had inflicted the extremities of retaliation upon Europe.
Whether it was the heathen of the steppes who were in question, from
Attila in the fifth century to Batu Khan in the thirteenth, or the
followers of the Prophet, who tore away from Christendom the southern
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> shores of the Mediterranean, and held Spain in their iron
grasp, while from age to age they exhausted their strength in vain
against the Eastern Empire, the threatening danger was always coming
with the morning sun; whatever might be the shock that took the
attention of Europe away from herself, it directed it upon Asia. This is
a fact of cardinal importance for us, inasmuch as it was directly
through the interest, more and more absorbing, which Europe felt in Asia
that the discovery of the western hemisphere was at last effected.</p>

<p>It was not only in war, but in commerce, that the fortunes of Europe
were dependent upon her relations with Asia. <span class="sidenote">Routes of trade between Europe and Asia.</span>
Since prehistoric times
there has always been some commercial intercourse between the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean and the peninsula of Hindustan. Tyre and
Sidon carried on such trade by way of the Red Sea.<a id="footnotetag310" name="footnotetag310"></a><a href="#footnote310" title="Go to footnote 310"><span class="small">[310]</span></a> After Alexander
had led his army to Samarcand and to the river Hyphasis, the
acquaintance of the Greeks with Asia was very considerably increased,
and important routes of trade were established. One was practically the
old Ph&oelig;nician route, with its western terminus moved from Tyre to
Alexandria. Another was by way of the Caspian sea, up the river Oxus,
and thence with camels to the banks of the Indus.<a id="footnotetag311" name="footnotetag311"></a><a href="#footnote311" title="Go to footnote 311"><span class="small">[311]</span></a> An intermediate
route was through Syria and by way of the Euphrates and the Persian
gulf; the route which at one time made the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span> greatness of
Palmyra. After the extension of Roman sway to the Nile, the Euphrates,
and the Euxine, these same routes continued to be used. The European
commodities carried to India were light woollen cloths, linens, coral,
black lead, various kinds of glass vessels, and wine. In exchange for
these the traders brought back to Europe divers aromatic spices, black
pepper, ivory, cotton fabrics, diamonds, sapphires, and pearls, silk
thread and silk stuffs.<a id="footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a><a href="#footnote312" title="Go to footnote 312"><span class="small">[312]</span></a> Detailed accounts of these commercial
transactions, and of the wealth of personal experiences that must have
been connected with them, are excessively scant. Of the Europeans who,
during all the centuries between Alexander and Justinian, made their way
to Hindustan or beyond, we know very few by name. The amount of
geographical information that was gathered during the first half of this
period is shown in the map <span class="sidenote">Claudius Ptolemy.</span>
representing Claudius Ptolemy's knowledge of
the earth, about the middle of the second century after Christ. Except
for the Scandinavian world, and some very important additions made to
the knowledge of Asia by Marco Polo, this map fairly represents the
maximum of acquaintance with the earth's surface possessed by Europeans
previous to the great voyages of the fifteenth century. It shows a dim
knowledge of the mouths of the Ganges, of the island of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span>
Ceylon, and of what we sometimes call Farther India. A very dim
knowledge, indeed; for the huge peninsula of Hindustan is shrunk into
insignificance, while Taprobane, or Ceylon, unduly magnified, usurps the
place belonging to the Deccan. At the same time we see that some hearsay
knowledge of China had made its way into the Roman world before the days
of Ptolemy. The two names by which China was first known to Europeans
were <span class="sidenote">Early mention of China.</span>
"Seres" or "Serica," and "Sinæ" or "Thin." These two differing
names are the records of two different methods of approach to different
parts of a vast country, very much as the Northmen called their part of
eastern North America "Vinland," while the Spaniards called their part
"Florida." The name "Seres" was given to northwestern China by traders
who approached it through the highlands of central Asia from Samarcand,
while "Sinæ" was the name given to southeastern China by traders who
approached it by way of the Indian ocean, and heard of it in India, but
never reached it. Apparently no European ships ever reached China before
the Portuguese, in 1517.<a id="footnotetag313" name="footnotetag313"></a><a href="#footnote313" title="Go to footnote 313"><span class="small">[313]</span></a> The name "Sinæ" or "Thin" seems to mean
the country of the "Tchin" dynasty, which ruled over the whole of China
in the second century before Christ, and over a portion of it for a much
longer time. The name "Seres," on the other hand, was always associated
with the trade in silks, and was known <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span> to the Romans in the
time of the Emperor Claudius,<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a><a href="#footnote314" title="Go to footnote 314"><span class="small">[314]</span></a> and somewhat earlier. The Romans in
Virgil's time set a high value upon silk, and every scrap of it they had
came from China. They knew nothing about the silk-worm, and supposed
that the fibres or threads of this beautiful stuff grew upon trees. Of
actual intercourse between the Roman and Chinese empires there was no
more than is implied in this current of trade, passing through many
hands. But that each knew, in a vague way, of the existence of the
other, there is no doubt.<a id="footnotetag315" name="footnotetag315"></a><a href="#footnote315" title="Go to footnote 315"><span class="small">[315]</span></a></p>

<p>In the course of the reign of Justinian, we get references at first hand
to India, and coupled withal to a general theory of cosmography. This
curious information we have in the book of the monk <span class="sidenote">Cosmas Indicopleustes.</span>
Cosmas
Indicopleustes, written somewhere between <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 530 and 550. A pleasant
book it is, after its kind. In his younger days Cosmas had been a
merchant, and in divers voyages had become familiar with the coasts of
Ethiopia and the Persian gulf, and had visited India and Ceylon. After
becoming a monk at Alexandria, Cosmas wrote his book of Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> geography,<a id="footnotetag316" name="footnotetag316"></a><a href="#footnote316" title="Go to footnote 316"><span class="small">[316]</span></a> maintaining, in opposition to Ptolemy, that
the earth is not a sphere, but a rectangular plane forming the floor of
the universe; the heavens rise on all four sides about this rectangle,
like the four walls of a room, and, at an indefinite height above the
floor, <span class="sidenote">Shape of the earth, according to Cosmas.</span>
these blue walls support a vaulted roof or firmament, in which
God dwells with the angels. In the centre of the floor are the inhabited
lands of the earth, surrounded on all sides by a great ocean, beyond
which, somewhere out in a corner, is the Paradise from which Adam and
Eve were expelled. In its general shape, therefore, the universe
somewhat resembles the Tabernacle in the Wilderness, or a modern
"Saratoga <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span> trunk." On the northern part of the floor, under the
firmament, is a lofty conical mountain, around which the sun, moon, and
planets perform their daily revolutions. In the summer the sun takes a
turn around the apex of the cone, and is, therefore, hidden only for a
short night; but in the winter he travels around the base, which takes
longer, and, accordingly, the nights are long. Such is the doctrine
drawn from Holy Scripture, says Cosmas, and as for the vain blasphemers
who pretend that the earth is a round ball, the Lord hath stultified
them for their sins until they impudently prate of Antipodes, where
trees grow downward and rain falls upward. As for such nonsense, the
worthy Cosmas cannot abide it.</p>

<p>I cite these views of Cosmas because there can be no doubt that they
represent beliefs current among the general public until after the time
of Columbus,<a id="footnotetag317" name="footnotetag317"></a><a href="#footnote317" title="Go to footnote 317"><span class="small">[317]</span></a> in spite of the deference paid to Ptolemy's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span>
views by the learned. Along with these cosmographical speculations,
Cosmas shows a wider geographical knowledge of Asia than any earlier
writer. He gives a good deal of interesting information about India and
Ceylon, and has a fairly correct idea of the position of China, which he
calls Tzinista or Chinistan. This land of silk is the remotest of all
the Indies, and beyond it "there is neither navigation nor inhabited
country.... And the Indian philosophers, called Brachmans, tell you that
if you were to stretch a straight cord from Tzinista through Persia to
the Roman territory, you would just divide the world in halves. And
mayhap they are right."<a id="footnotetag318" name="footnotetag318"></a><a href="#footnote318" title="Go to footnote 318"><span class="small">[318]</span></a></p>

<p>In the fourth and following centuries, Nestorian missionaries were very
active in Asia, <span class="sidenote">The Nestorians.</span>
and not only made multitudes of converts and established
metropolitan sees in such places as Kashgar and Herat, but even found
their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span> way into China. Their work forms an interesting though
melancholy chapter in history, but it does not seem to have done much
toward making Asia better known to Europe. As declared heretics, the
Nestorians were themselves almost entirely cut off from intercourse with
European Christians.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of the sudden rise of the vast Saracen empire, in
the seventh and eighth centuries, was to interpose a barrier to the
extension of intercourse between Europe and the Far East. <span class="sidenote">Effects of the Saracen conquests.</span>
Trade between
the eastern and western extremities of Asia went on more briskly than
ever, but it was for a long time exclusively in Mussulman hands. The
mediæval Arabs were bold sailors, and not only visited Sumatra and Java,
but made their way to Canton. Upon the southern and middle routes the
Arab cities of Cairo and Bagdad became thriving centres of trade; but as
Spain and the whole of northern Africa were now Arab countries, most of
the trade between east and west was conducted within Mussulman
boundaries. Saracen cruisers prowled in the Mediterranean and sorely
harassed the Christian coasts. During the eighth, ninth, and tenth
centuries, Europe was more shut in upon herself than ever before or
since. In many respects these were especially the dark ages of
Europe,&mdash;the period of least comfort and least enlightenment since the
days of pre-Roman barbarism. But from this general statement
Constantinople should be in great measure excepted. The current of
mediæval trade through the noble highway of the Dardanelles and the
Bosphorus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span> was subject to fluctuations, but it was always
great. The city of the Byzantine emperors was before all things a
commercial city, like Venice in later days. <span class="sidenote">Constantinople in the twelfth century.</span>
Until the time of the
Crusades Constantinople was the centre of the Levant trade. The great
northern route from Asia remained available for commercial intercourse
in this direction. Persian and Armenian merchants sent their goods to
Batoum, whence they were shipped to Constantinople; and silk was brought
from northwestern China by caravan to the Oxus, and forwarded thence by
the Caspian sea, the rivers Cyrus and Phasis, and the Euxine sea.<a id="footnotetag319" name="footnotetag319"></a><a href="#footnote319" title="Go to footnote 319"><span class="small">[319]</span></a>
When it was visited by Benjamin of Tudela in the twelfth century,
Constantinople was undoubtedly the richest and most magnificent city,
and the seat of the highest civilization, to be found anywhere upon the
globe.</p>

<p>In the days of its strength the Eastern Empire was the staunch bulwark
of Christendom against the dangerous assaults of Persian, Saracen, and
Turk; alike in prosperity and in calamity, it proved to be the teacher
and civilizer of the western world. The events which, at the close of
the eleventh century, brought thousands upon thousands of adventurous,
<span class="sidenote">The Crusades.</span>
keen-witted people from western Europe into this home of wealth and
refinement, were the occasion of the most remarkable intellectual
awakening that the world had ever witnessed up to that time. The
Crusades, in their beginning, were a symptom of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> the growing
energy of western Europe under the ecclesiastical reformation effected
by the mighty Hildebrand. They were the military response of Europe to
the most threatening, and, as time has proved, the most deadly of all
the blows that have ever been aimed at her from Asia. Down to this time
the Mahometanism with which Christendom had so long been in conflict was
a Mahometanism of civilized peoples. The Arabs and Moors were
industrious merchants, agriculturists, and craftsmen; in their society
one might meet with learned scholars, refined poets, and profound
philosophers. But at the end of the tenth century, Islam happened to
make converts of the Turks, a nomad race in the upper status of
barbarism, with flocks and herds and patriarchal families. Inspired with
the sudden zeal for conquest which has always characterized new converts
to Islam, the Turks began to pour down from the plains of central Asia
like a deluge upon the Eastern Empire. In 1016 they overwhelmed Armenia,
and presently advanced into Asia Minor. <span class="sidenote">Barbarizing character of Turkish conquest.</span>
Their mode of conquest was
peculiarly baleful, for at first they deliberately annihilated the works
of civilization in order to prepare the country for their nomadic life;
they pulled down cities to put up tents. Though they long ago ceased to
be nomads, they have to this day never learned to comprehend civilized
life, and they have been simply a blight upon every part of the earth's
surface which they have touched. At the beginning of the eleventh
century, Asia Minor was one of the most prosperous and highly civilized
parts of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span> the world;<a id="footnotetag320" name="footnotetag320"></a><a href="#footnote320" title="Go to footnote 320"><span class="small">[320]</span></a> and the tale of its devastation by
the terrible Alp Arslan and the robber chiefs that came after him is one
of the most mournful chapters in history. At the end of that century,
when the Turks were holding Nicæa and actually had their outposts on the
Marmora, it was high time for Christendom to rise <i>en masse</i> in
self-defence. The idea was worthy of the greatest of popes. Imperfectly
and spasmodically as it was carried out, it undoubtedly did more than
anything that had ever gone before toward strengthening the wholesome
sentiment of a common Christendom among the peoples of western Europe.
<span class="sidenote">General effects of the Crusades.</span>
The Crusades increased the power of the Church, which was equivalent to
putting a curb upon the propensities of the robber baron and making
labour and traffic more secure. In another way they aided this good work
by carrying off the robber baron in large numbers to Egypt and Syria,
and killing him there. In this way they did much toward ridding European
society of its most turbulent elements; while at the same time they gave
fresh development to the spirit of romantic adventure, and connected it
with something better than vagrant freebooting.<a id="footnotetag321" name="footnotetag321"></a><a href="#footnote321" title="Go to footnote 321"><span class="small">[321]</span></a> By renewing the
long-suspended <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> intercourse between the minds of western Europe
and the Greek culture of Constantinople, they served as a mighty
stimulus to intellectual curiosity, and had a large share in bringing
about that great thirteenth century renaissance which is forever
associated with the names of Giotto and Dante and Roger Bacon.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in these ways the Crusades were for our
forefathers in Europe the most bracing and stimulating events that
occurred in the whole millennium between the complicated disorders of
the fifth century and the outburst of maritime discovery in the
fifteenth. How far they justified themselves from the military point of
view, it is not so easy to say. On the one hand, they had much to do
with retarding the progress of the enemy for two hundred years; they
overwhelmed the Seljukian Turks so effectually that their successors,
the Ottomans, did not become formidable until about 1300, after the last
crusading wave had spent its force. <span class="sidenote">The Fourth Crusade.</span>
On the other hand, the Fourth
Crusade, with better opportunities than any of the others for striking a
crushing blow at the Moslem, played false to Christendom, and in 1204
captured and despoiled Constantinople in order to gratify Venice's
hatred of her commercial rival and superior. It was a sorry piece of
business, and one cannot look with unmixed pleasure at the four superb
horses that now adorn the front of the church of St. Mark as a trophy of
this unhallowed exploit.<a id="footnotetag322" name="footnotetag322"></a><a href="#footnote322" title="Go to footnote 322"><span class="small">[322]</span></a> One cannot <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span> help feeling that but
for this colossal treachery, the great city of Constantine, to which our
own civilization owes more than can ever be adequately told, might,
perhaps, have retained enough strength to withstand the barbarian in
1453, and thus have averted one of the most lamentable catastrophes in
the history of mankind.</p>

<p>The general effect of the Crusades upon Oriental commerce was to
increase the amount of traffic through Egypt and Syria. Of this
lucrative trade Venice got the lion's share, and while she helped
support the short-lived Latin dynasty upon the throne at Constantinople,
she monopolized a great part of the business of the Black Sea also.
<span class="sidenote">Rivalry between Venice and Genoa.</span>
But
in 1261 Venice's rival, Genoa, allied herself with the Greek emperor,
Michael Palæologus, at Nicæa, placed him upon the Byzantine throne, and
again cut off Venice from the trade that came through the Bosphorus.
From this time forth the mutual hatred between Venice and Genoa "waxed
fiercer than ever; no merchant fleet of either state could go to sea
without convoy, and wherever their ships met they fought. It was
something like the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span> state of things between Spain and England
in the days of Drake."<a id="footnotetag323" name="footnotetag323"></a><a href="#footnote323" title="Go to footnote 323"><span class="small">[323]</span></a> In the one case as in the other, it was a
strife for the mastery of the sea and its commerce. Genoa obtained full
control of the Euxine, took possession of the Crimea, and thus acquired
a monopoly of the trade from central Asia along the northern route. With
the fall of Acre in 1291, and the consequent expulsion of Christians
from Syria, Venice lost her hold upon the middle route. But with the
pope's leave<a id="footnotetag324" name="footnotetag324"></a><a href="#footnote324" title="Go to footnote 324"><span class="small">[324]</span></a> she succeeded in making a series of advantageous
commercial treaties with the new Mameluke sovereigns of Egypt, and the
dealings between the Red Sea and the Adriatic soon came to be
prodigious. The Venetians gained control of part of the Peloponnesus,
with many islands of the Ægean and eastern Mediterranean. During the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries their city was the most splendid and
luxurious in all Christendom.</p>

<p>Such a development of wealth in Venice and Genoa implies a large
producing and consuming area behind them, able to take and pay for the
costly products of India and China.
<span class="sidenote">Centres and routes of mediæval trade.</span>
Before the end of the thirteenth
century the volume of European trade had swelled to great proportions.
How full of historic and literary interest are the very names of the
centres and leading routes of this trade as it was established in those
days, with its outlook upon the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span> Mediterranean and the distant
East! Far up in the North we see Wisby, on the little isle of Gothland
in the Baltic, giving its name to new rules of international law; and
the merchants of the famous Hansa towns extending their operations as
far as Novgorod in one direction, and in another to the Steelyard in
London, where the pound of these honest "Easterlings" was adopted as the
"sterling" unit of sound money. Fats and tallows, furs and wax from
Russia, iron and copper from Sweden, strong hides and unrivalled wools
from England, salt cod and herring (much needed on meagre church
fast-days) from the North and Baltic seas, appropriately followed by
generous casks of beer from Hamburg, were sent southward in exchange for
fine cloths and tapestries, the products of the loom in Ghent and
Bruges, in Ulm and Augsburg, with delicious vintages of the Rhine,
supple chain armour from Milan, Austrian yew-wood for English long-bows,
ivory and spices, pearls and silks from Italy and the Orient. Along the
routes from Venice and Florence to Antwerp and Rotterdam we see the
progress in wealth and refinement, in artistic and literary
productiveness. We see the early schools of music and painting in Italy
meet with prompt response in Flanders; in the many-gabled streets of
Nuremberg we hear the voice of the Meistersinger, and under the low
oaken roof of a Canterbury inn we listen to joyous if sometimes naughty
tales erst told in pleasant groves outside of fever-stricken Florence.</p>

<p>With this increase of wealth and culture in central Europe there came a
considerable extension of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> knowledge and a powerful stimulus to
curiosity concerning the remote parts of Asia. The conquering career of
Jenghis Khan (1206-1227) had shaken the world to its foundations. In the
middle of that century, to adopt Colonel Yule's lively expression,
<span class="sidenote">Effects of the Mongol conquests.</span>
"throughout Asia and eastern Europe, scarcely a dog might bark without
Mongol leave, from the borders of Poland and the coast of Cilicia to the
Amur and the Yellow Sea." About these portentous Mongols, who had thus
in a twinkling overwhelmed China and Russia, and destroyed the Caliphate
of Bagdad, there was a refreshing touch of open-minded heathenism. They
were barbarians willing to learn. From end to end of Asia the barriers
were thrown down. It was a time when Alan chiefs from the Volga served
as police in Tunking, and Chinese physicians could be consulted at
Tabriz. For about a hundred years China was more accessible than at any
period before or since,&mdash;more even than to-day; and that country now for
the first time became really known to a few Europeans. In the northern
provinces of China, shortly before the Mongol deluge, there had reigned
a dynasty known as the <i>Khitai</i>, and hence China was (and still is)
commonly spoken of in central Asia as the country of the Khitai. When
this name reached European ears it became <span class="sidenote">Cathay.</span>
<i>Cathay</i>, the name by which
China was best known in Europe during the next four centuries.<a id="footnotetag325" name="footnotetag325"></a><a href="#footnote325" title="Go to footnote 325"><span class="small">[325]</span></a> In
1245, Friar John of Plano Carpini, a friend and disciple of St. Francis,
was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span> sent by Pope Innocent IV. <span class="sidenote">Carpini and Rubruquis.</span>
on a missionary errand to the
Great Khan, and visited him in his camp at Karakorum in the very depths
of Mongolia. In 1253 the king of France, St. Louis, sent another
Franciscan monk, Willem de Rubruquis, to Karakorum, on a mission of
which the purpose is now not clearly understood. Both these Franciscans
were men of shrewd and cultivated minds, especially Rubruquis, whose
narrative, "in its rich detail, its vivid pictures, its acuteness of
observation and strong good sense ... has few superiors in the whole
library of travel."<a id="footnotetag326" name="footnotetag326"></a><a href="#footnote326" title="Go to footnote 326"><span class="small">[326]</span></a> Neither Rubruquis nor Friar John visited China,
but they fell in with Chinese folk at Karakorum, and obtained
information concerning the geography of eastern Asia far more definite
than had ever before been possessed by Europeans. They both describe
<span class="sidenote">First knowledge of an eastern ocean beyond Cathay.</span>
Cathay as bordering upon an eastern ocean, and this piece of information
constituted the first important leap of geographical knowledge to the
eastward since the days of Ptolemy, who supposed that beyond the "Seres
and Sinæ" lay an unknown land of vast extent, "full of reedy and
impenetrable swamps."<a id="footnotetag327" name="footnotetag327"></a><a href="#footnote327" title="Go to footnote 327"><span class="small">[327]</span></a> The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> information gathered by
Rubruquis and Friar John indicated that there was an end to the
continent of Asia; that, not as a matter of vague speculation, but of
positive knowledge, Asia was bounded on the east, just as Europe was
bounded on the west, by an ocean.</p>

<p>Here we arrive at a notable landmark in the history of the Discovery of
America. Here from the camp of bustling heathen at Karakorum there is
brought to Europe the first announcement of a geographical fact from
which the poetic mind of <span class="sidenote">The data were thus prepared for Columbus;</span>
Christopher Columbus will hereafter reap a
wonderful harvest. This is one among many instances of the way in which,
throughout all departments of human thought and action, the glorious
thirteenth century was beginning to give shape to the problems of which
the happy solution has since made the modern world so different from the
ancient.<a id="footnotetag328" name="footnotetag328"></a><a href="#footnote328" title="Go to footnote 328"><span class="small">[328]</span></a> Since there is an ocean east of Cathay and an ocean west
of Spain, how natural the inference&mdash;and albeit quite wrong, how
amazingly fruitful&mdash;that these oceans are one and the same, so that by
sailing westward from Spain one might go straight to Cathay!
<span class="sidenote">but as yet nobody reasoned from these data to a practical
conclusion.</span>
The data
for such an inference were now all at hand, but it does not appear that
any one as yet reasoned from the data to the conclusion, although we
find Roger Bacon, in 1267, citing the opinions of Aristotle and other
ancient <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span> writers to the effect that the distance by sea from
the western shores of Spain to the eastern shores of Asia cannot be so
very great.<a id="footnotetag329" name="footnotetag329"></a><a href="#footnote329" title="Go to footnote 329"><span class="small">[329]</span></a> In those days it took a long time for such ideas to get
from the heads of philosophers into the heads of men of action; and in
the thirteenth century, when Cathay was more accessible by land than at
any time before or since, there was no practical necessity felt for a
water route thither. Europe still turned her back upon the Atlantic and
gazed more intently than ever upon Asia. Stronger and more general grew
the interest in Cathay.</p>

<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century, some members of the <span class="sidenote">The Polo brothers.</span>
Polo
family, one of the aristocratic families of Venice, had a commercial
house at Constantinople. Thence, in 1260, the brothers Nicolò and Maffeo
Polo started on a trading journey to the Crimea, whence one opportunity
after another for making money and gratifying their curiosity with new
sights led them northward and eastward to the Volga, thence into
Bokhara, and so on until they reached the court of the Great Khan, in
one of the northwestern provinces of Cathay. The reigning sovereign was
the famous Kublai Khan, grandson of the all-conquering Jenghis. Kublai
was an able and benevolent despot, earnest in the wish to improve the
condition of his Mongol kinsmen. He had never before met European
gentlemen, and was charmed with the cultivated and polished Venetians.
He seemed quite ready to enlist the Roman Church in aid of his
civilizing schemes, and entrusted the Polos with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> a message to
the Pope, asking him for a hundred missionary teachers. The brothers
reached <span class="sidenote">Kublai Khan's message to the Pope.</span>
Venice in 1269, and found that Pope Clement IV. was dead and
there was an interregnum. After two years Gregory X. was elected and
received the Khan's message, but could furnish only a couple of
Dominican friars, and these men were seized with the dread not
uncommonly felt for "Tartareans," and at the last moment refused to go.
Nicolò and his brother then set out in the autumn of 1271 to return to
China, taking with them Nicolò's son Marco, a lad of seventeen years.
From Acre they went by way of Bagdad to Hormuz, at the mouth of the
Persian gulf, apparently with the intention of proceeding thence by sea,
but for some reason changed their course, and travelled through Kerman,
Khorassan, and Balkh, to Kashgar, and thence by way of Yarkand and
Khotan, and across the desert of Gobi into northwestern China, where
they arrived in the summer of 1275, and found the Khan at Kaipingfu, not
far from the northern end of the Great Wall.</p>

<p>It has been said that the failure of Kublai's mission to the Pope led
him to apply to the Grand Lama, at Thibet, who responded more
efficiently and successfully than Gregory X., so that Buddhism seized
the chance which Catholicism failed to grasp. The Venetians, however,
lost nothing in the good Khan's esteem. <span class="sidenote">Marco Polo and his travels in Asia.</span>
Young Marco began to make
himself proficient in speaking and writing several Asiatic languages,
and was presently taken into the Khan's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> service. His name is
mentioned in the Chinese Annals of 1277 as a newly-appointed
commissioner of the privy council.<a id="footnotetag330" name="footnotetag330"></a><a href="#footnote330" title="Go to footnote 330"><span class="small">[330]</span></a> He remained in Kublai's service
until 1292, while his father and uncle were gathering wealth in various
ways. Marco made many official journeys up and down the Khan's vast
dominions, not only in civilized China, but in regions of the heart of
Asia seldom visited by Europeans to this day,&mdash;"a vast ethnological
garden," says Colonel Yule, "of tribes of various race and in every
stage of uncivilization." In 1292 a royal bride for the Khan of Persia
was to be sent all the way from Peking to Tabriz, and as war that year
made some parts of the overland route very unsafe, it was decided to
send her by sea. The three Polos had for some time been looking for an
opportunity to return to Venice, but Kublai was unwilling to have them
go. Now, however, as every Venetian of that day was deemed to be from
his very cradle a seasoned seadog, and as the kindly old Mongol
sovereign had an inveterate land-lubber's misgivings about ocean
voyages, he consented to part with his dear friends, so that he might
entrust the precious princess to their care. <span class="sidenote">First recorded voyage of Europeans around the Indo-Chinese
peninsula, 1292-94.</span>
They sailed from the port
of Zaiton (Chinchow) early in 1292, and after long delays on the coasts
of Sumatra and Hindustan, in order to avoid unfavourable monsoons, they
reached the Persian gulf in 1294. They found that the royal bridegroom,
somewhat advanced in years, had died before they started from China;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> so the young princess became the bride of his son. After
tarrying awhile in Tabriz, the Polos returned, by way of Trebizond and
the Bosphorus, <span class="sidenote">Return of the Polos to Venice.</span>
to Venice, arriving in 1295. When they got there, says
Ramusio, after their absence of four and twenty years, "the same fate
befel them as befel Ulysses, who, when he returned to his native Ithaca,
was recognized by nobody." Their kinsfolk had long since given them up
for dead; and when the three wayworn travellers arrived at the door of
their own palace, the middle-aged men now wrinkled graybeards, the
stripling now a portly man, all three attired in rather shabby clothes
of Tartar cut, and "with a certain indescribable smack of the Tartar
about them, both in air and accent," some words of explanation were
needed to prove their identity. After a few days they invited a party of
old friends to dinner, and bringing forth three shabby coats, ripped
open the seams and welts, and began pulling out and tumbling upon the
table such treasures of diamonds and emeralds, rubies and sapphires, as
could never have been imagined, "which had all been stitched up in those
dresses in so artful a fashion that nobody could have suspected the
fact." In such wise had they brought home from Cathay their ample
earnings; and when it became known about Venice that the three long-lost
citizens had come back, "straightway the whole city, gentle and simple,
flocked to the house to embrace them, and to make much of them, with
every conceivable demonstration of affection and respect."<a id="footnotetag331" name="footnotetag331"></a><a href="#footnote331" title="Go to footnote 331"><span class="small">[331]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span>
<p>Three years afterward, in 1298, Marco commanded a galley in the great
naval battle with the Genoese near Curzola. The Venetians were totally
defeated, and Marco was one of the 7,000 prisoners taken to Genoa, where
he was kept in durance for about a year. <span class="sidenote">Marco Polo's book written in prison at Genoa, 1299.</span>
One of his companions in
captivity was a certain Rusticiano, of Pisa, who was glad to listen to
his descriptions of Asia, and to act as his amanuensis. French was then,
at the close of the Crusades, a language as generally understood
throughout Europe as later, in the age of Louis XIV.; and Marco's
narrative was duly taken down by the worthy Rusticiano in rather lame
and shaky French. In the summer of 1299 Marco was set free and returned
to Venice, where he seems to have led a quiet life until his death in
1324.</p>

<p>"The Book of Ser Marco Polo concerning the Kingdoms and Marvels of the
East" is one of the most famous and important books of the Middle Ages.
<span class="sidenote">Its great contributions to geographical knowledge.</span>
It contributed more new facts toward a knowledge of the earth's surface
than any book that had ever been written before. Its author was "the
first traveller to trace a route across the whole longitude of Asia;"
the first to describe China in its vastness, with its immense cities,
its manufactures and wealth, and to tell, whether from personal
experience or direct hearsay, of Thibet and Burmah, of Siam and Cochin
China, of the Indian archipelago, with its islands of spices, of Java
and Sumatra, and of the savages of Andaman. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> knew of Japan
and the woful defeat of the Mongols there, when they tried to invade the
island kingdom in 1281. He gave a description of Hindustan far more
complete and characteristic than had ever before been published. From
Arab sailors, accustomed to the Indian ocean, he learned something about
Zanzibar and Madagascar and the semi-Christian kingdom of Abyssinia. To
the northward from Persia he described the country of the Golden Horde,
whose khans were then holding Russia in subjection; and he had gathered
some accurate information concerning Siberia as far as the country of
the Samoyeds, with their dog-sledges and polar bears.<a id="footnotetag332" name="footnotetag332"></a><a href="#footnote332" title="Go to footnote 332"><span class="small">[332]</span></a></p>

<p>Here was altogether too much geographical knowledge for European
ignorance in those days to digest. While Marco's book attracted much
attention, its influence upon the progress of geography was slighter
than it would have been if addressed to a more enlightened public. Many
of its sober statements of fact were received with incredulity. Many of
the places described were indistinguishable, in European imagination,
from the general multitude of fictitious countries mentioned in
fairy-tales or in romances of chivalry. Perhaps no part of Marco's story
was so likely to interest his readers as his references to <span class="sidenote">Prester John.</span>
Prester John.
In the course of the twelfth century the notion had somehow gained
possession of the European mind that somewhere out in the dim vastness
of the Orient there dwelt a mighty Christian potentate, known as John
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span> Presbyter or "Prester."<a id="footnotetag333" name="footnotetag333"></a><a href="#footnote333" title="Go to footnote 333"><span class="small">[333]</span></a> At different times he was
identified with various known Asiatic sovereigns. Marco Polo identified
him with one Togrul Wang, who was overcome and slain by the mighty
Jenghis; but he would not stay dead, any more than the grewsome warlock
in Russian nursery lore. The notion of Prester John and his wealthy
kingdom could no more be expelled from the European mind in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries than the kindred notion of El Dorado
in the sixteenth. The position of this kingdom was shifted about here
and there, as far as from Chinese Tartary to <span class="sidenote">The "Arimaspians."</span>
Abyssinia and back again,
but somewhere or other in people's vague mental picture of the East it
was sure to occur. Other remote regions in Asia were peopled with elves
and griffins and "one-eyed Arimaspians,"<a id="footnotetag334" name="footnotetag334"></a><a href="#footnote334" title="Go to footnote 334"><span class="small">[334]</span></a> and we may be sure that to
Marco's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> readers these beings were quite as real as the
polished citizens of Cambaluc (Peking) or the cannibals of the Andaman
islands. From such a chaos of ideas sound geographical knowledge must
needs be a slow evolution, and Marco Polo's acquisitions were altogether
too far in advance of his age to be readily assimilated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the Catalan map, made in 1375, and now to be seen in
the National Library at Paris, there is a thorough-going and not
unsuccessful attempt to embody the results of <span class="sidenote">Other visits to China.</span>
Polo's travels. In the
interval of three quarters of a century since the publication of Marco's
narrative, several adventurous travellers had found their way to Cathay.
There was Friar <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span> Odoric, of Pordenone, who, during the years
1316-30 visited Hindustan, Sumatra, Java, Cochin China, the Chinese
Empire, and Thibet.<a id="footnotetag335" name="footnotetag335"></a><a href="#footnote335" title="Go to footnote 335"><span class="small">[335]</span></a> It was from this worthy monk that the arrant

Cathay, seasoning them with yarns from Pliny and Ktesias, and grotesque
conceits of his own.<a id="footnotetag336" name="footnotetag336"></a><a href="#footnote336" title="Go to footnote 336"><span class="small">[336]</span></a> Several other missionary friars visited China
between 1302 and 1330, and about ten years after the latter date the
Florentine merchant, Francesco Pegolotti, wrote a very useful handbook
for commercial travellers on the overland <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span> route to that
country.<a id="footnotetag337" name="footnotetag337"></a><a href="#footnote337" title="Go to footnote 337"><span class="small">[337]</span></a> Between 1338 and 1353 Giovanni Marignolli spent some years

travelled in Ceylon and Hindustan.<a id="footnotetag338" name="footnotetag338"></a><a href="#footnote338" title="Go to footnote 338"><span class="small">[338]</span></a> That seems to have been the last
of these journeys to the Far East. <span class="sidenote">Overthrow of the Mongol dynasty, and shutting up of China.</span>
In 1368, the people of China rose
against the Mongol dynasty and overthrew it. The first emperor of the
native Ming dynasty was placed upon the throne, and the Chinese retorted
upon their late conquerors by overrunning vast Mongolia and making it
Chinese Tartary. The barriers thrown down by the liberal policy of the
Mongol sovereigns were now put up again, and no more foreigners were
allowed to set foot upon the sacred soil of the Flowery Kingdom.</p>


<p>Thus, for just a century,&mdash;from Carpini and Rubruquis to
Marignolli,&mdash;while China was open to strangers as never before or since,
a few Europeans had availed themselves of the opportunity in such wise
as to mark the beginning of a new era <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> in the history of
geographical knowledge. Though the discoveries of Marco Polo were as yet
but imperfectly appreciated, one point, and that the most significant of
all, was thoroughly established. It was shown that the continent of Asia
did not extend indefinitely eastward, nor was it bounded and barricaded
on that side, as Ptolemy had imagined, by vast impenetrable swamps. On
the contrary, its eastern shores were perfectly accessible through an
open sea, and half a dozen Europeans in Chinese ships had now actually
made the voyage between the coast of China and the Persian gulf.
Moreover, some hearsay knowledge&mdash;enough to provoke curiosity and
greed&mdash;had been gained of the existence of numerous islands in that
far-off <span class="sidenote">First rumours of the Molucca islands and Japan.</span>
eastern ocean, rich in the spices which from time immemorial had
formed such an important element in Mediterranean commerce. News, also,
had been brought to Europe of the wonderful island kingdom of Japan
(Cipango or Zipangu) lying out in that ocean some hundreds of miles
beyond the coast of Cathay. These were rich countries, abounding in
objects of lucrative traffic. Under the liberal Mongol rule the Oriental
trade had increased enough for Europe to feel in many ways its
beneficial effects. Now this trade began to be suddenly and severely
checked, and while access to the interior of Asia was cut off, European
merchants might begin to reflect upon the value of what they were
losing, and to consider if there were any feasible method of recovering
it.</p>

<p>It was not merely the shutting up of China by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span> the first Ming
emperor, in 1368, that checked the intercourse between Europe and Asia.
A still more baleful obstacle to all such intercourse had lately come
upon the scene. In Asia Minor the <span class="sidenote">The accustomed routes of Oriental trade cut off by the
Ottoman Turks.</span>
beastly Turk, whose career had been
for two centuries arrested by the Crusades, now reared his head again.
The Seljukian had been only scotched, not killed; and now he sprang to
life as the Ottoman, with sharper fangs than before. In 1365 the Turks
established themselves in the Balkan peninsula, with Adrianople as their
capital, and began tightening their coils about the doomed city of
Constantine. Each point that they gained meant the strangling of just so
much Oriental trade; for, as we have seen, the alliance of
Constantinople with Genoa since 1261 had secured to the latter city, and
to western Europe, the advantages of the overland routes from Asia,
whether through the Volga country or across Armenia. When at length, in
1453, the Turks took Constantinople, the splendid commercial career of
Genoa was cut with the shears of Atropos. At the same time, as their
power was rapidly extending over Syria and down toward Egypt,
threatening the overthrow of the liberal Mameluke dynasty there, the
commercial prosperity of Venice also was seriously imperilled. Moreover,
as Turkish corsairs began to swarm in the eastern waters of the
Mediterranean, the voyage became more and more unsafe for Christian
vessels. It was thus, while the volume of trade with Asia was, in the
natural course of things, swelling year by year, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> that its
accustomed routes were being ruthlessly cut off. It was fast becoming
necessary to consider whether there might not be other practicable
routes to <span class="sidenote">Necessity for finding an "outside route to the Indies."</span>
"the Indies" than those which had from time immemorial been
followed. Could there be such a thing as an "outside route" to that land
of promise? A more startling question has seldom been propounded; for it
involved a radical departure from the grooves in which the human mind
had been running ever since the days of Solomon. Two generations of men
lived and died while this question was taking shape, and all that time
Cathay and India and the islands of Spices were objects of increasing
desire, clothed by eager fancy with all manner of charms and riches. The
more effectually the eastern Mediterranean was closed, the stronger grew
the impulse to venture upon unknown paths in order to realize the vague
but glorious hopes that began to cluster about these remote countries.
Such an era of romantic enterprise as was thus ushered in, the world has
never seen before or since. It was equally remarkable as an era of
discipline in scientific thinking. In the maritime ventures of
unparalleled boldness now to be described, the human mind was groping
toward the era of enormous extensions of knowledge in space and time
represented by the names of Newton and Darwin. It was learning the right
way of putting its trust in the Unseen.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE SEARCH FOR THE INDIES.<br>

<p>As it dawned upon men's minds that to find some oceanic route from
Europe to the remote shores of <span class="sidenote">Question as to whether Asia could be reached by sailing
around Africa.</span>
Asia was eminently desirable, the first
attempt would naturally be to see what could be done by sailing down the
western coast of Africa, and ascertaining whether that continent could
be circumnavigated. It was also quite in the natural order of things
that this first attempt should be made by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>In the general history of the Middle Ages the Spanish peninsula had been
to some extent cut off from the main currents of thought and feeling
which actuated the rest of Europe. Its people had never joined the other
Christian nations in the Crusades, for the good reason that they always
had quite enough to occupy them in their own domestic struggle with the
Moors. From the throes of this prolonged warfare Portugal emerged
somewhat sooner than the Spanish kingdoms, and thus had somewhat earlier
a surplus of energy released for work of another sort. It was not
strange that the Portuguese should be the first people since the old
Northmen to engage in distant <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span> maritime adventure upon a grand
scale. Nor was it strange that Portuguese seamanship should at first
have thriven upon naval warfare with Mussulmans. It was in attempting to
suppress the intolerable nuisance of Moorish piracy that Portuguese
ships became accustomed to sail a little way down the west coast of
Africa; and such voyages, begun for military purposes, were kept up in
the interests of commerce, and presently served as a mighty stimulus to
geographical curiosity. We have now to consider at some length how grave
was the problem that came up for immediate solution.</p>

<hr>

<p>With regard to the circumnavigability of Africa two opposite opinions
were maintained by the ancient Greek and Latin writers whose authority
the men of the Middle Ages were wont to quote as decisive of every vexed
question. The old Homeric notion of an ocean encompassing the
terrestrial world, although mentioned with doubt by <span class="sidenote">Views of Eratosthenes, <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 276-196.</span>
Herodotus,<a id="footnotetag339" name="footnotetag339"></a><a href="#footnote339" title="Go to footnote 339"><span class="small">[339]</span></a>
continued to survive after the globular form of the earth had come to be
generally maintained by ancient geographers. The greatest of these
geographers, Eratosthenes, correctly assumed that the Indian ocean was
continuous with the Atlantic,<a id="footnotetag340" name="footnotetag340"></a><a href="#footnote340" title="Go to footnote 340"><span class="small">[340]</span></a> and that Africa could be
circumnavigated, just as he incorrectly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span> assumed that the
Caspian sea was a huge gulf communicating with a northern ocean, by
which it would be possible to sail around the continent of Asia as he
imagined it.<a id="footnotetag341" name="footnotetag341"></a><a href="#footnote341" title="Go to footnote 341"><span class="small">[341]</span></a> A similar opinion as to Africa was held by Posidonius
and by Strabo.<a id="footnotetag342" name="footnotetag342"></a><a href="#footnote342" title="Go to footnote 342"><span class="small">[342]</span></a> It was called in question, however, by
Polybius,<a id="footnotetag343" name="footnotetag343"></a><a href="#footnote343" title="Go to footnote 343"><span class="small">[343]</span></a> and was flatly denied by the great astronomer Hipparchus,
who thought that certain observations on the tides, reported by Seleucus
of Babylon, proved that there could be no connection between the
Atlantic and Indian oceans.<a id="footnotetag344" name="footnotetag344"></a><a href="#footnote344" title="Go to footnote 344"><span class="small">[344]</span></a> Claudius Ptolemy, writing in the second
century after Christ, <span class="sidenote">Opposing theory of Ptolemy, cir. <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 150.</span>
followed the opinion of Hipparchus, and carried to
an extreme the reaction against Eratosthenes. By Ptolemy's time the
Caspian had been proved to be an inland sea, and it was evident that
Asia extended much farther to the north and east than had once been
supposed. This seems to have discredited in his mind the whole
conception of outside oceans, and he not only gave an indefinite
northward and eastward extension to Asia and an indefinite southern
extension to Africa, but brought these two continents together far to
the southeast, thus making the Indian ocean a land-locked sea.<a id="footnotetag345" name="footnotetag345"></a><a href="#footnote345" title="Go to footnote 345"><span class="small">[345]</span></a></p>

<p>These views of Hipparchus and Ptolemy took <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span> no heed of the
story told to Herodotus of the circumnavigation of Africa by a
Ph&oelig;nician <span class="sidenote">Story of the Ph&oelig;nician voyage, in the time of Necho.</span>
squadron at some time during the reign of Necho in Egypt
(610-595 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>).<a id="footnotetag346" name="footnotetag346"></a><a href="#footnote346" title="Go to footnote 346"><span class="small">[346]</span></a> The Ph&oelig;nician ships were said to have sailed
from the Red Sea and to have returned through the Mediterranean in the
third year after starting. In each of the two autumn seasons they
stopped and sowed grain and waited for it to ripen, which in southern
Africa would require ten or twelve weeks.<a id="footnotetag347" name="footnotetag347"></a><a href="#footnote347" title="Go to footnote 347"><span class="small">[347]</span></a> On their return to Egypt
they declared ("I for my part do not believe them," says Herodotus, "but
perhaps others may") that in thus sailing from east to west around
Africa they had the sun upon their right hand. About this alleged voyage
there has been a good deal of controversy.<a id="footnotetag348" name="footnotetag348"></a><a href="#footnote348" title="Go to footnote 348"><span class="small">[348]</span></a> No other expedition in
any wise comparable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> to it for length and difficulty can be
cited from ancient history, and a critical scholar is inclined to look
with suspicion upon all such accounts of unique and isolated events. As
we have not the details of the story, it is impossible to give it a
satisfactory critical examination. The circumstance most likely to
convince us of its truth is precisely that which dear old Herodotus
deemed incredible. The position of the sun, to the north of the
mariners, is something that could hardly have been imagined by people
familiar only with the northern hemisphere. It is therefore almost
certain that Necho's expedition sailed beyond the equator.<a id="footnotetag349" name="footnotetag349"></a><a href="#footnote349" title="Go to footnote 349"><span class="small">[349]</span></a> But that
is as far as inference can properly carry us; for our experience of the
uncritical temper of ancient narrators is enough to suggest that such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> an achievement might easily be magnified by rumour into the
story told, more than a century after the event, to Herodotus. The data
are too slight to justify us in any dogmatic opinion. One thing,
however, is clear. Even if the circumnavigation was effected,&mdash;which, on
the whole, seems improbable,&mdash;it remained quite barren of results. It
produced no abiding impression upon men's minds<a id="footnotetag350" name="footnotetag350"></a><a href="#footnote350" title="Go to footnote 350"><span class="small">[350]</span></a> and added nothing
to geographical knowledge. The veil of mystery was not lifted from
southern Africa. The story was doubted by Strabo and Posidonius, and
passed unheeded, as we have seen, by Hipparchus and Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Of Ph&oelig;nician and other voyages along the Atlantic coast of Africa we
have much more detailed and trustworthy information. As early as the
twelfth century before Christ traders from Tyre had founded Cadiz
(Gades),<a id="footnotetag351" name="footnotetag351"></a><a href="#footnote351" title="Go to footnote 351"><span class="small">[351]</span></a> and at a later date the same hardy people seem to have
made the beginnings of Lisbon (Olisipo). From such advanced stations
Tyrian and Carthaginian ships sometimes found their way northward as far
as Cornwall, and in the opposite direction fishing voyages were made
along the African coast. <span class="sidenote">Voyage of Hanno.</span>
The most remarkable undertaking in this quarter
was the famous voyage of the Carthaginian commander Hanno, whose own
brief but interesting account <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span> of it has been preserved.<a id="footnotetag352" name="footnotetag352"></a><a href="#footnote352" title="Go to footnote 352"><span class="small">[352]</span></a>
This expedition consisted of sixty penteconters (fifty-oared ships), and
its chief purpose was colonization. Upon the Mauritanian coast seven
small trading stations were founded, one of which&mdash;Kerne, at the mouth
of the Rio d' Ouro<a id="footnotetag353" name="footnotetag353"></a><a href="#footnote353" title="Go to footnote 353"><span class="small">[353]</span></a>&mdash;existed for a long time. From this point Hanno
made two voyages of exploration, the second of which carried him as far
as Sierra Leone and the neighbouring Sherboro island, where he found
"wild men and women covered with hair," called by the interpreters
"gorillas."<a id="footnotetag354" name="footnotetag354"></a><a href="#footnote354" title="Go to footnote 354"><span class="small">[354]</span></a> At that point the ships turned back, apparently for
want of provisions.</p>

<p>No other expedition in ancient times is known to have proceeded so far
south as Sierra Leone. Two other voyages upon this Atlantic coast are
mentioned, but without definite details. The one was that of Sataspes
(about 470 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>), narrated <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> by Herodotus, who merely tells us
that a coast was reached where undersized men, clad in palm-leaf
garments, <span class="sidenote">Voyages of Sataspes and Eudoxus.</span>
fled to the hills at sight of the strange visitors.<a id="footnotetag355" name="footnotetag355"></a><a href="#footnote355" title="Go to footnote 355"><span class="small">[355]</span></a> The
other was that of Eudoxus (about 85 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>), related by Posidonius, the
friend and teacher of Cicero. The story is that this Eudoxus, in a
voyage upon the east coast of Africa, having a philological turn of
mind, wrote down the words of some of the natives whom he met here and
there along the shore. He also picked up a ship's prow in the form of a
horse's head, and upon his return to Alexandria some merchants professed
to recognize it as belonging to a ship of Cadiz. Eudoxus thereupon
concluded that Africa was circumnavigable, and presently sailed through
the Mediterranean and out upon the Atlantic. Somewhere upon the coast of
Mauritania he found natives who used some words of similar sound to
those which he had written down when visiting the eastern coast, whence
he concluded that they were people of the same race. At this point he
turned back, and the sequel of the story was unknown to Posidonius.<a id="footnotetag356" name="footnotetag356"></a><a href="#footnote356" title="Go to footnote 356"><span class="small">[356]</span></a></p>

<p>It is worthy of note that both Pliny and Pomponius Mela, quoting
Cornelius Nepos as their authority, speak of Eudoxus as having
circumnavigated Africa from the Red Sea to Cadiz; and Pliny, moreover,
tells us that Hanno sailed around that continent as far as
Arabia,<a id="footnotetag357" name="footnotetag357"></a><a href="#footnote357" title="Go to footnote 357"><span class="small">[357]</span></a>&mdash;a statement which is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span> clearly false. These
examples show how stories grow when carelessly and uncritically
repeated, <span class="sidenote">Wild exaggerations.</span>
and they strongly tend to confirm the doubt with which one is
inclined to regard the tale of Necho's sailors above mentioned. In
truth, the island of Gorillas, discovered by Hanno, was doubtless the
most southerly point on that coast reached by navigators in ancient
times. Of the islands in the western ocean the Carthaginians certainly
knew the Canaries (where they have left undoubted inscriptions),
probably also the Madeiras, and possibly the Cape Verde group.<a id="footnotetag358" name="footnotetag358"></a><a href="#footnote358" title="Go to footnote 358"><span class="small">[358]</span></a></p>

<p>Pomponius Mela's World, cir. <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 50.</p>
</div>

<p>The extent of the knowledge which the ancients thus had of western
Africa is well illustrated in the map representing the geographical
theories of Pomponius Mela, whose book was written about <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 50. Of
the eastern coast and the interior <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> Mela knew less than Ptolemy
a century later, <span class="sidenote">Views of Pomponius Mela, cir. <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 50.</span>
but of the Atlantic coast he knew more than Ptolemy.
The fact that the former geographer was a native of Spain and the latter
a native of Egypt no doubt had something to do with this. Mela had
profited by the Carthaginian discoveries. His general conception of the
earth was substantially that of Eratosthenes. It was what has been
styled the "oceanic" <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span> theory, in contrast with the
"continental" theory of Ptolemy. In the unvisited regions on all sides
of the known world Eratosthenes imagined vast oceans, Ptolemy imagined
vast deserts or impenetrable swamps. The former doctrine was of course
much more favourable to maritime enterprise than the latter. The works
of Ptolemy exercised over the mediæval mind an almost despotic sway,
which, in spite of their many merits, was in some respects a hindrance
to progress; so that, inasmuch as the splendid work of Strabo, the most
eminent follower of Eratosthenes, was unknown to mediæval Europe until
about 1450, it was fortunate that the Latin treatise of Mela was
generally read and highly esteemed. People in those days were such
uncritical readers that very likely the antagonism between Ptolemy and
Mela may have failed to excite comment,<a id="footnotetag359" name="footnotetag359"></a><a href="#footnote359" title="Go to footnote 359"><span class="small">[359]</span></a> especially in view of the
lack of suitable maps such as emphasize that antagonism to our modern
minds. But in the fifteenth century, when men were getting their first
inklings of critical scholarship, and when the practical question of an
ocean voyage to Asia was pressing for solution, such a point could no
longer fail to attract attention; and it happened fortunately that the
wet theory, no less than the dry theory, had a popular advocate among
those classical authors to whose authority so much deference was paid.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span>

<p>If the Portuguese mariners of the generation before Columbus had
acquiesced in Ptolemy's views as final, they surely would not have
devoted their energies to the task of circumnavigating Africa. But there
were yet other theoretical or fanciful obstacles in the way. When you
look at a modern map of the world, the "five zones" may seem like a mere
graphic device <span class="sidenote">Ancient theory of the five zones.</span>
for marking conveniently the relations of different
regions to the solar source of heat; but before the great Portuguese
voyages and the epoch-making third voyage of Vespucius, to be described
hereafter, a discouraging doctrine was entertained with regard to these
zones. Ancient travellers in Scythia and voyagers to "Thule"&mdash;which in
Ptolemy's scheme perhaps meant the Shetland isles<a id="footnotetag360" name="footnotetag360"></a><a href="#footnote360" title="Go to footnote 360"><span class="small">[360]</span></a>&mdash;had learned
something of Arctic phenomena. The long winter nights,<a id="footnotetag361" name="footnotetag361"></a><a href="#footnote361" title="Go to footnote 361"><span class="small">[361]</span></a> the snow and
ice, and the bitter winds, made a deep impression upon visitors from the
Mediterranean;<a id="footnotetag362" name="footnotetag362"></a><a href="#footnote362" title="Go to footnote 362"><span class="small">[362]</span></a> and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> when such facts were contrasted with
the scorching blasts that came from Sahara, the resulting theory was
undeniably plausible. In the extreme north the ocean must be frozen and
the country uninhabitable by reason of the cold; contrariwise, in the
far south the ocean must be boiling hot and the country inhabitable only
by gnomes and salamanders. Applying these ideas to the conception of the
earth as a sphere, Pomponius Mela tells us that the surface of the
sphere is divided into five zones, of which only two are fit to support
human life. About each pole stretches a dead and frozen zone; the
southern and northern hemispheres have each a temperate zone, with the
same changes of seasons, but not occurring at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span> same (but
opposite) times; the north temperate zone is the seat of the &OElig;cumene
(&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;), or Inhabited
World; the south temperate <span class="sidenote">The Inhabited World and the Antipodes.</span>
zone is also inhabited by the Antichthones or
Antipodes, but about these people we know nothing, because between us
and them there intervenes the burning zone, which it is impossible to
cross.<a id="footnotetag363" name="footnotetag363"></a><a href="#footnote363" title="Go to footnote 363"><span class="small">[363]</span></a></p>

<p>This notion of an antipodal world in the southern hemisphere will have
especial interest for us when we come to deal with the voyages of
Vespucius. The idea seems to have originated in a guess of Hipparchus
that Taprobane&mdash;the island of Ceylon, about which the most absurd
reports were brought to Europe&mdash;might be the beginning of another world.
This is very probable, says Mela, with delightful <i>naïveté</i>, because
Taprobane is inhabited, and still we do not know of anybody who has ever
made the tour of it.<a id="footnotetag364" name="footnotetag364"></a><a href="#footnote364" title="Go to footnote 364"><span class="small">[364]</span></a> Mela's contemporary, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span> the elder
Pliny, declares that Taprobane <span class="sidenote">Curious notions about Ceylon.</span>
"has long been regarded" as part of
another world, the name of which is Antichthon, or Opposite-Earth;<a id="footnotetag365" name="footnotetag365"></a><a href="#footnote365" title="Go to footnote 365"><span class="small">[365]</span></a>
at the same time Pliny vouchsafes three closely-printed pages of
information about this mysterious country. Throughout the Middle Ages
the conception of some sort of an antipodal inhabited world was vaguely
entertained by writers here and there, but many of the clergy condemned
it as implying the existence of people cut off from the knowledge of the
gospel and not included in the plan of salvation.</p>

<p>As to the possibility of crossing the torrid zone, opinion was not
unanimous. Greek explorers from Alexandria (cir. <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 100) seem to have
gone far up the Nile toward the equator, and the astronomer Geminus
quotes their testimony in proof of his opinion that the torrid zone is
inhabitable.<a id="footnotetag366" name="footnotetag366"></a><a href="#footnote366" title="Go to footnote 366"><span class="small">[366]</span></a> Panætius, the friend of the younger Scipio Africanus,
had already expressed a similar opinion. But the flaming theory
prevailed. Macrobius, writing about six hundred years later, maintained
that the southernmost limit of the habitable earth was 850 miles south
of Syene, which lies just under the tropic of Cancer.<a id="footnotetag367" name="footnotetag367"></a><a href="#footnote367" title="Go to footnote 367"><span class="small">[367]</span></a> Beyond this
point no man could go without danger from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> fiery
atmosphere. <span class="sidenote">The fiery zone.</span>
Beyond some such latitude on the ocean no ship could venture
without risk of being engulfed in some steaming whirlpool.<a id="footnotetag368" name="footnotetag368"></a><a href="#footnote368" title="Go to footnote 368"><span class="small">[368]</span></a> Such was
the common belief before the great voyages of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Besides this dread of the burning zone, another fanciful obstacle beset
the mariner who proposed to undertake a long voyage upon the outer
ocean. It had been observed that a ship which disappears in the offing
seems to be going downhill; and many people feared that if they should
happen thus to descend too far away from the land they could never get
back again. <span class="sidenote">Going downhill.</span>
Men accustomed to inland sea travel did not feel this dread
within the regions of which they had experience, but it assailed them
whenever they thought of braving the mighty waters outside.<a id="footnotetag369" name="footnotetag369"></a><a href="#footnote369" title="Go to footnote 369"><span class="small">[369]</span></a> Thus
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> master mariner, in the Middle Ages, might contemplate the
possible chance of being drawn by force of gravity into the fiery gulf,
should he rashly approach too near; and in such misgivings he would be
confirmed by Virgil, who was as much read then as he is to-day and
esteemed an authority, withal, on scientific questions; for according to
Virgil the Inhabited World descends toward the equator and has its apex
in the extreme north.<a id="footnotetag370" name="footnotetag370"></a><a href="#footnote370" title="Go to footnote 370"><span class="small">[370]</span></a></p>

<p>To such notions as these, which were supposed to have some sort of
scientific basis, we must add the wild superstitious fancies that
clustered about all remote and unvisited corners of the world. In maps
made in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in such places as we
should label "Unexplored Region," there were commonly depicted uncouth
shapes of "Gorgons and Hydras and Chimæras <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span> dire," furnishing
eloquent testimony to the feelings with which the unknown was regarded.
<span class="sidenote">Superstitious fancies.</span>
The barren wastes of the Sea of Darkness awakened a shuddering dread
like that with which children shrink from the gloom of a cellar. When we
remember all these things, and consider how the intelligent purpose
which urged the commanders onward was scarcely within the comprehension
of their ignorant and refractory crews, we can begin to form some idea
of the difficulties that confronted the brave mariners who first sought
an ocean route to the far-off shores of Cathay.</p>

<p>Less formidable than these obstacles based on fallacious reasoning or
superstitious whim were those that were furnished by the clumsiness of
the ships and the crudeness of the appliances for navigation. As already
observed, the Spanish and Portuguese caravels of the fifteenth century
were less <span class="sidenote">Clumsiness of the caravels.</span>
swift and manageable craft than the Norwegian "dragons" of the
tenth. Mere yachts in size we should call them, but far from yachtlike
in shape or nimbleness. With their length seldom more than thrice their
width of beam, with narrow tower-like poops, with broad-shouldered bows
and bowsprit weighed down with spritsail yards, and with no canvas
higher than a topsail, these clumsy caravels could make but little
progress against head-winds, and the amount of tacking and beating to
and fro was sometimes enough to quadruple the length of the voyage. For
want of metallic sheathing below the waterline the ship was liable to be
sunk by the terrible <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> worm which, in Hakluyt's phrase, "many
times pearceth and eateth through the strongest oake." For want of
vegetable food in the larder, or anything save the driest of bread and
beef stiffened with brine, the sailors were sure to be attacked by
scurvy, and in a very long voyage the crew was deemed fortunate that did
not lose half its number from that foul disease. <span class="sidenote">Famine and scurvy.</span>
Often in traversing
unknown seas the sturdy men who survived all other perils were brought
face to face with starvation when they had ventured too far without
turning back.<a id="footnotetag371" name="footnotetag371"></a><a href="#footnote371" title="Go to footnote 371"><span class="small">[371]</span></a> We need not wonder that the first steps in oceanic
discovery were slow and painful.</p>

<p>First among the instruments without which systematic ocean navigation
would have been impossible, the magnetic compass had been introduced
into southern Europe and <span class="sidenote">The mariner's compass.</span>
was used by Biscayan and Catalan sailors before
the end of the twelfth century.<a id="footnotetag372" name="footnotetag372"></a><a href="#footnote372" title="Go to footnote 372"><span class="small">[372]</span></a> Parties of Crusaders had learned
the virtues of the suspended needle from the Arabs, who are said to have
got their knowledge indirectly from China in the course of their eastern
voyages.<a id="footnotetag373" name="footnotetag373"></a><a href="#footnote373" title="Go to footnote 373"><span class="small">[373]</span></a> It seems to have been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span> at Amalfi that the needle
was first enclosed in a box and connected with a graduated compass-card.
Apparently it had not come into general use in the middle of the
thirteenth century, for in 1258 the famous Brunetto Latini, afterwards
tutor of Dante, made a visit to Roger Bacon, of which he gives a
description in a letter to his friend the poet Guido Cavalcanti: "The
Parliament being summoned to assemble at Oxford, I did not fail to see
Friar Bacon as soon as I arrived, and (among other things) he showed me
a black ugly stone called a magnet, which has the surprising property of
drawing iron to it; and upon which, if a needle be rubbed, and
afterwards fastened to a straw so that it shall swim upon water, the
needle will instantly turn toward the Pole-star: therefore, be the night
ever so dark, so that neither moon nor star be visible, yet shall the
mariner be able, by the help of this needle, to steer his vessel aright.
This discovery, which appears useful in so great a degree to all who
travel by sea, must remain concealed until other times; because no
master mariner dares to use it lest he should fall under the imputation
of being a magician; nor would the sailors venture themselves out to sea
under his command, if he took with him an instrument which carries so
great an appearance of being constructed under the influence of some
infernal spirit.<a id="footnotetag374" name="footnotetag374"></a><a href="#footnote374" title="Go to footnote 374"><span class="small">[374]</span></a> A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> time may arrive when these prejudices,
which are of such great hindrance to researches into the secrets of
nature, will be overcome; and it will be then that mankind shall reap
the benefit of the labours of such learned men as Friar Bacon, and do
justice to that industry and intelligence for which he and they now meet
with no other return than obloquy and reproach."<a id="footnotetag375" name="footnotetag375"></a><a href="#footnote375" title="Go to footnote 375"><span class="small">[375]</span></a></p>


<p>That time was after all not so long in arriving, for by the end of the
thirteenth century the compass had come to be quite generally used,<a id="footnotetag376" name="footnotetag376"></a><a href="#footnote376" title="Go to footnote 376"><span class="small">[376]</span></a>
and the direction of a ship's course could be watched continuously in
foul and fair weather alike. For taking the sun's altitude rude
astrolabes and jack-staffs were in use, very crazy affairs as compared
with the modern quadrant, but sufficiently accurate to enable a
<span class="sidenote">Latitude and longitude.</span>
well-trained observer, in calculating his latitude, to get somewhere
within two or three degrees of the truth. In calculating longitude the
error was apt to be much greater, for in the absence of chronometers
there were no accurate means for marking differences in time. It was
necessary to depend upon the dead-reckoning, and the custom was first to
sail due north or south to the parallel of the place of destination and
then to turn at right angles and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span> sail due east or west. Errors
of eight or even ten degrees were not uncommon. Thus at the end of a
long outward voyage the ship might find itself a hundred miles or more
to the north or south, and six or seven hundred miles to the east or
west, of the point at which it had been aimed. Under all these
difficulties, the approximations made to correct sailing by the most
skilful mariners were sometimes wonderful. Doubtless this very poverty
of resources served to sharpen their watchful sagacity.<a id="footnotetag377" name="footnotetag377"></a><a href="#footnote377" title="Go to footnote 377"><span class="small">[377]</span></a> To sail the
seas was in those days a task requiring high mental equipment; it was no
work for your commonplace skipper. Human faculty was taxed to its
utmost, and human courage has never been more grandly displayed than by
the glorious sailors of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<hr>

<p>We are now prepared to appreciate the character of the work that was
done in the course of the first attempts to find an oceanic route from
Europe to Asia. <span class="sidenote">Prince Henry the Navigator, 1394-1463.</span>
Then, as in other great epochs of history, men of genius
arose to meet the occasion. In 1394 was born Prince Henry of Portugal,
since known as Henry the Navigator.<a id="footnotetag378" name="footnotetag378"></a><a href="#footnote378" title="Go to footnote 378"><span class="small">[378]</span></a> He was fourth son of King John
I., <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>(p. 317)</span> the valiant and prudent king under whom began the golden
age of Portugal, which lasted until the conquest of that country in 1580
by Philip II. of Spain. Henry's mother was Philippa, daughter of John of
Gaunt. He was therefore cousin to our own Henry V. of England, whom he
quite equalled in genius, while the laurels that he won were more
glorious than those of Agincourt. In 1415, being then in his
twenty-first year, Prince Henry played a distinguished part in the
expedition which captured Ceuta from the Moors. While in Morocco he
gathered such information as he could concerning the interior of the
continent; he learned something about the oases of Sahara, the distant
river Gambia, and the caravan trade between Tunis and Timbuctoo, whereby
gold was carried from the Guinea coast to Mussulman ports on the
Mediterranean. If this coast could be reached by sea, its gold might be
brought to Lisbon as well. To divert such treasure from the infidel and
secure it for a Christian nation was an enterprise fitted to kindle a
prince's enthusiasm. While Henry felt the full force of these
considerations, his thoughts took a wider range. The views of Pomponius
Mela had always been held in high esteem by scholars of the Spanish
peninsula,<a id="footnotetag379" name="footnotetag379"></a><a href="#footnote379" title="Go to footnote 379"><span class="small">[379]</span></a> and down past that Gold Coast Prince Henry saw <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span>
the ocean route to the Indies, the road whereby a vast empire might be
won for <span class="sidenote">His idea of an ocean route to the Indies, and what it might
bring.</span>
Portugal and millions of wandering heathen souls might be
gathered into the fold of Christ. To doubt the sincerity of the latter
motive, or to belittle its influence, would be to do injustice to Prince
Henry,&mdash;such cynical injustice as our hard-headed age is only too apt to
mete out to that romantic time and the fresh enthusiasm which inspired
its heroic performances. Prince Henry was earnest, conscientious,
large-minded, and in the best sense devout; and there can be no question
that in his mind, as in that of Columbus, and (with somewhat more alloy)
in the minds of Cortes and others, the desire of converting the heathen
and strengthening the Church served as a most powerful incentive to the
actions which in the course of little more than a century quite changed
the face of the world.</p>

<p>Filled with such lofty and generous thoughts, Prince Henry, on his
return from Morocco, in 1418, chose for himself a secluded place of
abode where he could devote himself to his purposes undisturbed by the
court life at Lisbon or by political solicitations of whatever sort. In
the Morocco campaign he had won such military renown that he was now
invited by Pope Martin V. to take chief command of the papal army; and
presently he received similar flattering offers from his own cousin,
Henry V. of England, from John II. of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span> Castile, and from the
Emperor Sigismund, who, for shamefully violating his imperial word and
permitting the burning of John Huss, was now sorely pressed by the
enraged and rebellious Bohemians. Such invitations had no charm for
Henry. Refusing them one and all, <span class="sidenote">The Sacred Promontory.</span>
he retired to the promontory of
Sagres, in the southernmost province of Portugal, the ancient kingdom of
Algarve, of which his father now appointed him governor. That lonely and
barren rock, protruding into the ocean, had long ago impressed the
imagination of Greek and Roman writers; they called it the Sacred
Promontory, and supposed it to be the westernmost limit of the habitable
earth.<a id="footnotetag380" name="footnotetag380"></a><a href="#footnote380" title="Go to footnote 380"><span class="small">[380]</span></a> There the young prince proceeded to build an astronomical
observatory, the first that his country had ever seen, and to gather
about him a school of men competent to teach and men eager to learn the
mysteries of map-making and the art of navigation. There he spent the
greater part of his life; thence he sent forth his captains to plough
the southern seas; and as year after year the weather-beaten ships
returned from their venturesome pilgrimage, the first glimpse of home
that greeted them was likely to be the beacon-light in the tower where
the master sat poring over problems of Archimedes or watching the stars.
For Henry, whose motto was "Talent de bien faire," or (in the old French
usage) "Desire<a id="footnotetag381" name="footnotetag381"></a><a href="#footnote381" title="Go to footnote 381"><span class="small">[381]</span></a> to do well," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span> was wont to throw himself
whole-hearted into whatever he undertook, and the study of astronomy and
mathematics he pursued so zealously as to reach a foremost place among
the experts of his time. With such tastes and such ambition, he was
singularly fortunate in wielding ample pecuniary resources; if such a
combination could be more often realized, the welfare of mankind would
be notably enhanced. Prince Henry was Grand Master of the Order of
Christ, an organization half military, half religious, and out of its
abundant revenues he made the appropriations needful for the worthy
purpose of advancing the interests of science, converting the heathen,
and winning a commercial empire for Portugal. At first he had to
encounter the usual opposition to lavish expenditure for a distant
object without hope of immediate returns; but after a while his dogged
perseverance began to be rewarded with such successes as to silence all
adverse comment.</p>

<p>The first work in hand was the rediscovery of coasts and islands that
had ceased to be visited even before the breaking up of the Roman
Empire. <span class="sidenote">The Madeira and Canary islands.</span>
For more than a thousand years the Madeiras and Canaries had
been well-nigh forgotten, and upon the coast of the African continent no
ship ventured beyond Cape Non, the headland so named because it said
"No!" to the wistful mariner.<a id="footnotetag382" name="footnotetag382"></a><a href="#footnote382" title="Go to footnote 382"><span class="small">[382]</span></a> There <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> had been some
re-awakening of maritime activity in the course of the fourteenth
century, chiefly due, no doubt, to the use of the compass. Between 1317
and 1351 certain Portuguese ships, with Genoese pilots, had visited not
only the Madeiras and Canaries, but even the Azores, a thousand miles
out in the Atlantic; and these groups of islands are duly laid down upon
the so-called Medici map of 1351, preserved in the Laurentian library at
Florence.<a id="footnotetag383" name="footnotetag383"></a><a href="#footnote383" title="Go to footnote 383"><span class="small">[383]</span></a> The voyage to the Azores was probably the greatest feat
of ocean navigation that had been performed down to that time, but it
was not followed by colonization. Again, somewhere about 1377 Madeira
seems to have been visited by Robert Machin, an Englishman, whose
adventures make a most romantic story; and in 1402 the Norman knight,
Jean de Béthencourt, had begun to found a colony in the Canaries, for
which, in return for aid and supplies, he did homage to the King of
Castile.<a id="footnotetag384" name="footnotetag384"></a><a href="#footnote384" title="Go to footnote 384"><span class="small">[384]</span></a> As for the African <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> coast, Cape Non had also been
passed at some time during the fourteenth century, for Cape Bojador is
laid down on the Catalan map of 1375; but beyond that point no one had
dared take the risks of the unknown sea.</p>

<p>The first achievement under Prince Henry's guidance was the final
rediscovery and colonization of Porto Santo and Madeira in 1418-25 by
Gonsalvez Zarco, Tristam Vaz, and Bartholomew Perestrelo.<a id="footnotetag385" name="footnotetag385"></a><a href="#footnote385" title="Go to footnote 385"><span class="small">[385]</span></a> This work
occupied the prince's attention for some years, and then came up the
problem of Cape Bojador. The difficulty was twofold; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span> the waves
about that headland were apt to be boisterous, and wild sailor's fancies
were apt to enkindle a mutinous spirit in the crews. <span class="sidenote">Gil Eannes passes Cape Bojador.</span>
It was not until
1433-35 that Gil Eannes, a commander of unusually clear head and steady
nerves, made three attempts and fairly passed the dreaded spot. In the
first attempt he failed, as his predecessors had done, to double the
cape; in the second attempt he doubled it; in the third he sailed nearly
two hundred miles beyond.</p>

<p>Portuguese voyages on the coast of Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>This achievement of Gil Eannes (<i>anglicè</i>, plain Giles Jones) marks an
era. It was the beginning of great things. When we think of the
hesitation with which this step was taken, and the vociferous applause
that greeted the successful captain, it is strange to reflect that babes
were already born in 1435 who were to live to hear of the prodigious
voyages of Columbus and Gama, Vespucius and Magellan. After seven years
a further step was taken in advance; in 1442 Antonio Gonçalves brought
gold and <span class="sidenote">Beginning of the modern slave-trade, 1442.</span>
negro slaves from the Rio d' Ouro, or Rio del Oro, four hundred
miles beyond Cape Bojador. Of this beginning of the modern slave-trade I
shall treat in a future chapter.<a id="footnotetag386" name="footnotetag386"></a><a href="#footnote386" title="Go to footnote 386"><span class="small">[386]</span></a> Let it suffice here to observe
that Prince Henry did not discourage but sanctioned it. The first aspect
which this baleful traffic assumed in his mind was that of a means for
converting the heathen, by bringing black men and women to Portugal to
be taught the true faith and the ways of civilized people, that they
might in due season be sent back to their native <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span> land to
instruct their heathen brethren. The kings of Portugal should have a
Christian empire in <span class="sidenote">Papal grant of heathen countries to the Portuguese crown.</span>
Africa, and in course of time the good work might be
extended to the Indies. Accordingly a special message was sent to Pope
Eugenius IV., informing him of the discovery of the country of these
barbarous <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> people beyond the limits of the Mussulman world, and
asking for a grant in perpetuity to Portugal of all heathen lands that
might be discovered in further voyages beyond Cape Bojador, even so far
as to include the Indies.<a id="footnotetag387" name="footnotetag387"></a><a href="#footnote387" title="Go to footnote 387"><span class="small">[387]</span></a> The request found favour in the eyes of
Eugenius, and the grant was solemnly confirmed by succeeding popes. To
these proceedings we shall again have occasion to refer. We have here to
observe that the discovery of gold and the profits of the
slave-trade&mdash;though it was as yet conducted upon a very small
scale&mdash;served to increase the interest of the Portuguese people in
Prince Henry's work and to diminish the obstacles in his way. A
succession of gallant captains, whose names make a glorious roll of
honour, carried on the work of exploration, reaching the farthest point
that had been attained by the ancients. In 1445 Dinis Fernandez passed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span> Cape Verde, and two years later Lançarote found the mouth of
the Gambia. In 1456 Luigi Cadamosto&mdash;a Venetian captain in the service
of Portugal&mdash;went as far as the Rio Grande; in 1460 Diego Gomez
<span class="sidenote">Advance to Sierra Leone.</span>
discovered the Cape Verde islands; and in 1462 Piedro de Cintra reached
Sierra Leone.<a id="footnotetag388" name="footnotetag388"></a><a href="#footnote388" title="Go to footnote 388"><span class="small">[388]</span></a> At the same time, in various expeditions between 1431
and 1466, the Azores (i. e. "Hawk" islands) were rediscovered and
colonized, and voyages out into the Sea of Darkness began to lose
something of their manifold terrors.</p>

<p>Prince Henry did not live to see Africa circumnavigated. At the time of
his death, in 1468, his ships had not gone farther than the spot where
Hanno found his gorillas two thousand years before. But the work of this
excellent prince did not end with his death. His adventurous spirit
lived on in the school of accomplished navigators he had trained. Many
voyages were made after 1462, of which we need mention only those that
marked new stages of discovery. In 1471 two knights of the royal
household, João de Santarem and Pedro de Escobar, sailed down the Gold
Coast and crossed the equator; <span class="sidenote">Advance to the Hottentot coast.</span>
three years later the line was again
crossed by Fernando Po, discoverer of the island that bears his name. In
1484 Diego Cam went on as far as the mouth of the Congo, and entered
into <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> very friendly relations with the negroes there. In a
second voyage in 1485 this enterprising captain pushed on a thousand
miles farther, and set up a cross in 22° south latitude on the coast of
the Hottentot country. Brisk trading went on along the Gold Coast, and
missionaries were sent to the Congo.<a id="footnotetag389" name="footnotetag389"></a><a href="#footnote389" title="Go to footnote 389"><span class="small">[389]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span>

<p>These voyages into the southern hemisphere dealt a damaging blow to the
theory of an impassable <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> fiery zone; but as to the
circumnavigability of the African continent, the long stretch of coast
beyond the equator seemed more in harmony with Ptolemy's views than with
those of Mela. <span class="sidenote">Effect of these discoveries upon the theories of
Ptolemy and Mela.</span>
The eastward trend of the Guinea coast was at first in
favour of the latter geographer, but when Santarem and Escobar found it
turning southward to the equator the facts began to refute him.
According to Mela <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span> they should have found it possible at once
to sail eastward to the gulf of Aden. What if it should turn out after
all that there was no connection between the Atlantic and Indian oceans?
Every added league of voyaging toward the tropic of Capricorn must have
been fraught with added discouragement, for it went to prove that, even
if Ptolemy's theory was wrong, at any rate the ocean route to Asia was
indefinitely longer than had been supposed. But was it possible to
imagine any other route that should be more direct? To a trained mariner
of original and imaginative mind, sojourning in Portugal and keenly
watching the progress of African discovery, the years just following the
voyage of Santarem and Escobar would be a period eminently fit for
suggesting such a question. Let us not forget this date of 1471 while we
follow Prince Henry's work to its first grand climax.</p>

<p>About the time that Diego Cam was visiting the tribes on the Congo, the
negro king of Benin, a country by the mouth of the Niger, sent an
embassy to John II. of Portugal (Prince Henry's nephew), with a request
that missionary priests might be sent to Benin. It has been thought that
the woolly-haired chieftain was really courting an alliance with the
Portuguese, or perhaps he thought their "medicine men" might have the
knack of confounding his foes. The negro envoy told King John that a
thousand miles or so east of Benin there was an august sovereign who
ruled over many subject peoples, and at whose court there was an order
of chivalry whose badge or emblem was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span> a brazen cross. Such, at
least, was the king's interpretation of the negro's words, and forthwith
he jumped to the conclusion that this <span class="sidenote">News of Prester John.</span>
African potentate must be Prester
John, whose name was redolent of all the marvels of the mysterious East.
To find Prester John would be a long step toward golden Cathay and the
isles of spice. So the king of Portugal rose to the occasion, and
attacked the problem on both flanks at once. He sent Pedro de Covilham
by way of Egypt to Aden, and he sent Bartholomew Dias, with three
fifty-ton caravels, to make one more attempt to find an end to the
Atlantic coast of Africa.</p>

<p>Covilham's journey was full of interesting experiences. He sailed from
Aden to Hindustan, and on his return visited <span class="sidenote">Covilham's journey.</span>
Abyssinia, where the
semi-Christian king took such a liking to him that he would never let
him go. So Covilham spent the rest of his life, more than thirty years,
in Abyssinia, whence he was able now and then to send to Portugal items
of information concerning eastern Africa that were afterwards quite
serviceable in voyages upon the Indian ocean.<a id="footnotetag390" name="footnotetag390"></a><a href="#footnote390" title="Go to footnote 390"><span class="small">[390]</span></a></p>

<p>The daring captain, Bartholomew Dias, started in August, 1486, and after
passing nearly four hundred miles beyond the tropic of Capricorn, was
driven due south before heavy winds for thirteen days without seeing
land. At the end of this stress of weather he turned his prows eastward,
expecting soon to reach the coast. But as he had passed the southernmost
point of Africa <span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span> and no land appeared before him, after a while
<span class="sidenote">Bartholomew Dias passes the Cape of Good Hope and enters the
Indian ocean.</span>
he steered northward and landed near the mouth of Gauritz river, more
than two hundred miles east of the Cape of Good Hope. Thence he pushed
on about four hundred miles farther eastward as far as the Great Fish
river (about 33° 30' S., 27° 10' E.), where the coast begins to have a
steady trend to the northeast. Dias was now fairly in the Indian ocean,
and could look out with wistful triumph upon that waste of waters, but
his worn-out crews refused to go any farther and he was compelled
reluctantly to turn back. On the way homeward the ships passed in full
sight of the famous headland which Dias called the Stormy Cape; but
after arriving at Lisbon, in December, 1487, when the report of this
noble voyage was laid before King John II., his majesty said, Nay, let
it rather be called the Cape of Good Hope, since there was now much
reason to believe that they had found the long-sought ocean route to the
Indies.<a id="footnotetag391" name="footnotetag391"></a><a href="#footnote391" title="Go to footnote 391"><span class="small">[391]</span></a> Though this opinion turned out to be correct, it is well
for us to remember that the proof was not yet complete. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> No one
could yet say with certainty that the African coast, if followed a few
miles east of Great Fish river, would not again trend southward and run
all the way to the pole. The completed proof was not obtained until
Vasco da Gama crossed the Indian ocean ten years later.</p>

<p>This voyage of Bartholomew Dias was longer and in many respects more
remarkable than any that is known to have been made before that time.
From Lisbon back to Lisbon, reckoning the sinuosities of the coast, but
making no allowance for tacking, the distance run by those tiny craft
was not less than thirteen thousand miles. <span class="sidenote">Some effects of the discovery.</span>
This voyage completed the
overthrow of the fiery-zone doctrine, so far as Africa was concerned; it
penetrated far into the southern temperate zone where Mela had placed
his antipodal world; it dealt a staggering blow to the continental
theory of Ptolemy; and its success made men's minds readier for yet more
daring enterprises. Among the shipmates of Dias on this ever memorable
voyage was a <span class="sidenote">Bartholomew Columbus.</span>
well-trained and enthusiastic Italian mariner, none other
than Bartholomew, the younger brother of Christopher Columbus. There was
true dramatic propriety in the presence of that man at just this time;
for not only did all these later African voyages stand in a direct
causal relation to the discovery of America, but as an immediate
consequence of the doubling of the Cape of Good Hope we shall presently
find Bartholomew Columbus in the very next year on his way to England,
to enlist the aid of King Henry VII. in behalf of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span> a scheme of
unprecedented boldness for which his elder brother had for some years
been seeking to obtain the needful funds. Not long after that
disappointing voyage of Santarem and Escobar in 1471, this original and
imaginative sailor, Christopher Columbus, had conceived (or adopted and
made his own) a new method of solving the problem of an ocean route to
Cathay. We have now to sketch the early career of this epoch-making man,
and to see how he came to be brought into close relations with the work
of the Portuguese explorers.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>


<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span> CHAPTER V.<br>

<span class="smaller">THE SEARCH FOR THE INDIES.<br>

<i>WESTWARD OR SPANISH ROUTE.</i></span></h2>


<p>Our information concerning the life of Columbus before 1492 is far from
being as satisfactory as one could wish. Unquestionably he is to be
deemed fortunate in having had for his biographers two such men as his
friend Las Casas, one of the noblest characters and most faithful
historians of that or any age, and his own son Ferdinand Columbus, a
most accomplished scholar and bibliographer. <span class="sidenote">Sources of information concerning the life of Columbus: Las
Casas and Ferdinand Columbus.</span>
The later years of
Ferdinand's life were devoted, with loving care, to the preparation of a
biography of his father; and his book&mdash;which unfortunately survives only
in the Italian translation of Alfonso Ulloa,<a id="footnotetag392" name="footnotetag392"></a><a href="#footnote392" title="Go to footnote 392"><span class="small">[392]</span></a> published in Venice in
1571&mdash;is of priceless value. As Washington Irving long ago wrote, it is
"an invaluable document, entitled to great faith, and is the
cornerstone <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span> of the history of the American continent."<a id="footnotetag393" name="footnotetag393"></a><a href="#footnote393" title="Go to footnote 393"><span class="small">[393]</span></a>
After Ferdinand's death, in 1539, his papers seem to have passed into
the hands of Las Casas, who, from 1552 to 1561, in the seclusion of the
college of San Gregorio at Valladolid, was engaged in writing his great
"History of the Indies."<a id="footnotetag394" name="footnotetag394"></a><a href="#footnote394" title="Go to footnote 394"><span class="small">[394]</span></a> Ferdinand's superb library, one of the
finest in Europe, was bequeathed to the cathedral at Seville.<a id="footnotetag395" name="footnotetag395"></a><a href="#footnote395" title="Go to footnote 395"><span class="small">[395]</span></a> It
contained some twenty thousand volumes in print and manuscript, four
fifths of which, through shameful neglect or vandalism, have perished or
been scattered. Four thousand volumes, however, are still preserved, and
this library <span class="sidenote">The Biblioteca Colombina at Seville.</span>
(known as the "Biblioteca Colombina") is full of interest
for the historian. Book-buying was to Ferdinand Columbus one of the most
important occupations in life. His books were not only carefully
numbered, but on the last leaf of each one he wrote a memorandum of the
time and place of its purchase and the sum of money paid for it.<a id="footnotetag396" name="footnotetag396"></a><a href="#footnote396" title="Go to footnote 396"><span class="small">[396]</span></a>
This habit of Ferdinand's has furnished <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> us with clues to the
solution of some interesting questions. Besides this, he was much given
to making marginal notes and comments, which are sometimes of immense
value, and, more than all, there are still to be seen in this library a
few books that belonged to Christopher Columbus himself, with very
important notes in his own handwriting and in that of his brother
Bartholomew. Las Casas was familiar with this grand collection in the
days of its completeness, he was well acquainted with all the members of
the Columbus family, and he had evidently read the manuscript sources of
Ferdinand's book; for a comparison with Ulloa's version shows that
considerable portions of the original Spanish text&mdash;or of the documents
upon which it rested&mdash;are preserved in the work of Las Casas.<a id="footnotetag397" name="footnotetag397"></a><a href="#footnote397" title="Go to footnote 397"><span class="small">[397]</span></a> The
citation and adoption of Ferdinand's statements by the latter writer,
who was able independently to verify them, is therefore in most cases
equivalent to corroboration, and the two writers together form an
authority of the weightiest kind, and not lightly to be questioned or
set aside.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span>

<p>Besides these books of most fundamental importance, we have valuable
accounts of some parts of the life of Columbus by his friend Andres
Bernaldez, <span class="sidenote">Bernaldez and Peter Martyr.</span>
the curate of Los Palacios near Seville.<a id="footnotetag398" name="footnotetag398"></a><a href="#footnote398" title="Go to footnote 398"><span class="small">[398]</span></a> Peter Martyr,
of Anghiera, by Lago Maggiore, was an intimate friend of Columbus, and
gives a good account of his voyages, besides mentioning him in sundry
epistles.<a id="footnotetag399" name="footnotetag399"></a><a href="#footnote399" title="Go to footnote 399"><span class="small">[399]</span></a> Columbus himself, moreover, was such a voluminous writer
that his contemporaries laughed about it. "God grant," says Zuñiga in a
letter to the Marquis de Pescara, "God grant that Gutierrez may never
come short for paper, for he writes more than Ptolemy, more than
Columbus, the man who discovered the Indies."<a id="footnotetag400" name="footnotetag400"></a><a href="#footnote400" title="Go to footnote 400"><span class="small">[400]</span></a>
These <span class="sidenote">Letters of Columbus.</span>
writings are in
great part lost, though doubtless a good many things will yet be brought
to light in Spain by persistent rummaging. We have, however, from sixty
to seventy letters and reports by Columbus, of which twenty-three at
least are in his own handwriting; and all these have been
published.<a id="footnotetag401" name="footnotetag401"></a><a href="#footnote401" title="Go to footnote 401"><span class="small">[401]</span></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, while these contemporary materials <span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span> give us
abundant information concerning the great discoverer, from the year 1492
until his death, it is quite otherwise with his earlier years,
especially before his arrival in Spain in 1484. His own allusions to
these earlier years are sometimes hard to interpret;<a id="footnotetag402" name="footnotetag402"></a><a href="#footnote402" title="Go to footnote 402"><span class="small">[402]</span></a> and as for his
son Ferdinand, that writer confesses, with characteristic and winning
frankness, <span class="sidenote">Defects in Ferdinand's information.</span>
that his information is imperfect, inasmuch as filial respect
had deterred him from closely interrogating his father on such points,
or, to tell the plain truth, being still very young when his father
died, he had not then come to recognize their importance.<a id="footnotetag403" name="footnotetag403"></a><a href="#footnote403" title="Go to footnote 403"><span class="small">[403]</span></a> This does
not seem strange when we reflect that Ferdinand must have seen very
little of his father until in 1502, at the age of fourteen, he
accompanied him on that last difficult and disastrous voyage, in which
the sick and harassed old man could have had but little time or strength
for aught but the work in hand. It is not strange that when, a quarter
of a century later, the son set about his literary task, he should now
and then have got a date wrong, or have narrated some incidents
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span> in a confused manner, or have admitted some gossiping stories,
the falsehood of which can now plainly be detected. Such blemishes,
which occur chiefly in the earlier part of Ferdinand's book, do not
essentially detract from its high authority.<a id="footnotetag404" name="footnotetag404"></a><a href="#footnote404" title="Go to footnote 404"><span class="small">[404]</span></a> The limits which
bounded the son's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> accurate knowledge seem also to have bounded
that of such friends as Bernaldez, who did not become acquainted with
Columbus until after his arrival in Spain.</p>

<p>In recent years elaborate researches have been made, by Henry Harrisse
and others, in the archives of Genoa, Savona, Seville, and other places
with <span class="sidenote">Researches of Henry Harrisse.</span>
which Columbus was connected, in the hope of supplementing this
imperfect information concerning his earlier years.<a id="footnotetag405" name="footnotetag405"></a><a href="#footnote405" title="Go to footnote 405"><span class="small">[405]</span></a> A number of
data have thus been obtained, which, while clearing up the subject most
remarkably in some directions, have been made to mystify and embroil it
in others. There is scarcely a date or a fact relating to Columbus
before 1492 but has been made the subject of hot dispute; and some
pretty wholesale reconstructions of his biography have been
attempted.<a id="footnotetag406" name="footnotetag406"></a><a href="#footnote406" title="Go to footnote 406"><span class="small">[406]</span></a> The general impression, however, which the discussions
of the past twenty years have left upon my mind, is that the more
violent hypotheses are not likely <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span> to be sustained, and that
the newly-ascertained facts do not call for any very radical
interference with the traditional lines upon which the life of Columbus
has heretofore been written.<a id="footnotetag407" name="footnotetag407"></a><a href="#footnote407" title="Go to footnote 407"><span class="small">[407]</span></a> At any rate there seems to be no
likelihood of such interference as to modify our views of the causal
sequence of events that led to the westward search for the Indies; and
it is this relation of cause and effect that chiefly concerns us in a
history of the Discovery of America.</p>

<hr>

<p>The date of the birth of Columbus is easy to determine approximately,
but hard to determine with precision. In the voluminous discussion upon
this subject the extreme limits assigned have been 1430 and 1456, but
neither of these extremes is admissible, and our choice really lies
somewhere between <span class="sidenote">Date of the birth of Columbus: archives of Savona.</span>
1436 and 1446. Among the town archives of Savona is a
deed of sale executed August 7, 1473, by the father of Christopher
Columbus, and ratified by Christopher and his next brother
Giovanni.<a id="footnotetag408" name="footnotetag408"></a><a href="#footnote408" title="Go to footnote 408"><span class="small">[408]</span></a> Both brothers must then have attained <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span> their
majority, which in the republic of Genoa was fixed at the age of
twenty-five. Christopher, therefore, can hardly have been less than
seven and twenty, so that the latest probable date for his birth is
1446, and this is the date accepted by Muñoz, Major, Harrisse, and
Avezac. There is no documentary proof, however, to prevent our taking an
earlier date; and the curate of Los Palacios&mdash;strong authority on such a
point&mdash;says <span class="sidenote">Statement of Bernaldez.</span>
expressly that at the time of his death, in 1506, Columbus
was "in a good old age, seventy years a little more or less."<a id="footnotetag409" name="footnotetag409"></a><a href="#footnote409" title="Go to footnote 409"><span class="small">[409]</span></a> Upon
this statement Navarrete and Humboldt have accepted 1436 as the probable
date of birth.<a id="footnotetag410" name="footnotetag410"></a><a href="#footnote410" title="Go to footnote 410"><span class="small">[410]</span></a> The most plausible objection to this is a statement
made by Columbus himself in a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella, written
in 1501. In this letter, as first given in the biography by his son,
Columbus says that he was of "very tender age" when he began to sail the
seas, an occupation which he has kept up until the present moment; and
in the next sentence but one he adds that "now for forty years I have
been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> in this business and have gone to every place where there
is any navigation up to the present time."<a id="footnotetag411" name="footnotetag411"></a><a href="#footnote411" title="Go to footnote 411"><span class="small">[411]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Columbus's letter of September, 1501.</span>
The expression "very
tender age" agrees with Ferdinand's statement that his father was
fourteen years old when he first took to the sea.<a id="footnotetag412" name="footnotetag412"></a><a href="#footnote412" title="Go to footnote 412"><span class="small">[412]</span></a> Since 1446 +
14-40 = 1500, it is argued that Columbus was probably born about 1446;
some sticklers for extreme precision say 1447. But now there were eight
years spent by Columbus in Spain, from 1484 to 1492, without any voyages
at all; they were years, as he forcibly says, "dragged out in
disputations."<a id="footnotetag413" name="footnotetag413"></a><a href="#footnote413" title="Go to footnote 413"><span class="small">[413]</span></a> Did he mean to include those eight years in his
forty spent upon the sea? Navarrete thinks he did not. When he wrote
under excitement, as in this letter, his language was apt to be loose,
and it is fair to construe it according to the general probabilities of
the case. This addition of eight years brings his statement
substantially into harmony with that of Bernaldez, which it really will
not do to set aside lightly. Moreover, in the original text of the
letter, since published by Navarrete, Columbus appears to say, "now for
<i>more than</i> forty years," so that the agreement with Bernaldez becomes
practically complete.<a id="footnotetag414" name="footnotetag414"></a><a href="#footnote414" title="Go to footnote 414"><span class="small">[414]</span></a> The good curate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> spoke from direct
personal acquaintance, and his phrases "seventy years" and "a good old
age" <span class="sidenote">The balance of probability is in favour of 1436.</span>
are borne out by the royal decree of February 23, 1505, permitting
Columbus to ride on a mule, instead of a horse, by reason of his old age
(<i>ancianidad</i>) and infirmities.<a id="footnotetag415" name="footnotetag415"></a><a href="#footnote415" title="Go to footnote 415"><span class="small">[415]</span></a> Such a phrase applies much better
to a man of sixty-nine than to a man of fifty-nine. On the whole, I
think that Washington Irving showed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span> good sense in accepting
the statement of the curate of Los Palacios as decisive, dating as it
does the birth of Columbus at 1436, "a little more or less."</p>

<p>With regard to the place where the great discoverer was born there ought
to be no dispute, since we have his own most explicit and unmistakable
word for it, as I shall presently show. Nevertheless there has been no
end of dispute. He has been claimed by as many places as Homer,<a id="footnotetag416" name="footnotetag416"></a><a href="#footnote416" title="Go to footnote 416"><span class="small">[416]</span></a> but
the only real question is whether he was born in the city of Genoa or in
some neighbouring village within the boundaries of the Genoese republic.
It is easy to understand how doubt has arisen on this point, if we trace
the changes of residence of his family. The grandfather of Columbus
seems to have been Giovanni Colombo, of Terrarossa, an inland hamlet
some twenty miles east by north from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> Genoa. Giovanni's son,
Domenico Colombo, was probably born at Terrarossa, and moved thence with
his father, somewhere between <span class="sidenote">The family of Domenico Colombo, and its changes of
residence.</span>
1430 and 1445, to Quinto al Mare, four
miles east of Genoa on the coast. All the family seem to have been
weavers. Before 1445, but how many years before is not known, Domenico
married Susanna Fontanarossa, who belonged to a family of weavers,
probably of Quezzi, four miles northeast of Genoa. Between 1448 and 1451
Domenico, with his wife and three children, moved into the city of
Genoa, where he became the owner of a house and was duly qualified as a
citizen. In 1471 Domenico moved to Savona, thirty miles west on the
Corniche road, where he set up a weaving establishment and also kept a
tavern. He had then five children, Cristoforo, Giovanni, Bartolommeo,
Giacomo, and a daughter. Domenico lived in Savona till 1484. At that
time his wife and his son Giovanni were dead, Giacomo was an apprentice,
learning the weaver's trade, Christopher and Bartholomew had long been
domiciled in Portugal, the daughter had married a cheese merchant in
Genoa, and to that city Domenico returned in the autumn of 1484, and
lived there until his death, at a great age, in 1499 or 1500. He was
always in pecuniary difficulties, and died poor and in debt, though his
sons seem to have sent him from Portugal and Spain such money as they
could spare.<a id="footnotetag417" name="footnotetag417"></a><a href="#footnote417" title="Go to footnote 417"><span class="small">[417]</span></a></p>

<p>The reader will observe that Christopher and his two next brothers were
born before the family <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span> went to live in the city of Genoa. It
has hence been plausibly inferred that they were born either in Quinto
or in Terrarossa; more likely the latter, since both Christopher and
Bartholomew, as well as their father, were called, and sometimes signed
themselves, Columbus of Terrarossa.<a id="footnotetag418" name="footnotetag418"></a><a href="#footnote418" title="Go to footnote 418"><span class="small">[418]</span></a> In this opinion the most
indefatigable modern investigator, Harrisse, agrees with Las Casas.<a id="footnotetag419" name="footnotetag419"></a><a href="#footnote419" title="Go to footnote 419"><span class="small">[419]</span></a>
Nevertheless, in a solemn legal instrument executed February 22, 1498,
establishing a <i>mayorazgo</i>, or right of succession to his estates and
emoluments in the Indies, <span class="sidenote">Christopher tells us that he was born in the city of Genoa.</span>
Columbus expressly declares that he was born
in the city of Genoa: "I enjoin it upon my son, the said Don Diego, or
whoever may inherit the said <i>mayorazgo</i>, always to keep and maintain in
the City of Genoa one person of our lineage, because from thence I came
and in it I was born."<a id="footnotetag420" name="footnotetag420"></a><a href="#footnote420" title="Go to footnote 420"><span class="small">[420]</span></a> I do not see how such a definite and
positive statement, occurring in such a document, can be doubted or
explained away. It seems clear that the son was born while the parents
were dwelling either at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> Terrarossa or at Quinto, but what is
to hinder our supposing that the event might have happened when the
mother was in the city on some errand or visit? The fact that
Christopher and his brother were often styled "of Terrarossa" does not
prove that they were born in that hamlet. A family moving thence to
Quinto and to Genoa would stand in much need of some such distinctive
epithet, because the name Colombo was extremely common in that part of
Italy; insomuch that the modern historian, who prowls among the archives
of those towns, must have a care lest he get hold of the wrong person,
and thus open a fresh and prolific source of confusion. This has
happened more than once.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it seems most probable that the Discoverer of
America was born in the city of Genoa in 1436, or not much later. Of his
childhood we know next to nothing. Las Casas tells us that he studied at
the University of Pavia and acquired a good knowledge of Latin.<a id="footnotetag421" name="footnotetag421"></a><a href="#footnote421" title="Go to footnote 421"><span class="small">[421]</span></a>
This has been doubted, as incompatible with the statement of Columbus
that he began a seafaring life at the age of fourteen. <span class="sidenote">Christopher's early years.</span>
It is clear,
however, that the earlier years of Columbus, before his departure for
Portugal, were not all spent in seafaring. Somewhere, if not at Pavia,
he not only learned Latin, but found time to study geography, with a
little astronomy and mathematics, and to become an expert draughtsman.
He seems to have gone to and fro upon the Mediterranean in merchant
voyages, now and then <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> taking a hand in sharp scrimmages with
Mussulman pirates.<a id="footnotetag422" name="footnotetag422"></a><a href="#footnote422" title="Go to footnote 422"><span class="small">[422]</span></a> In the intervals of this adventurous life he was
probably to be found in Genoa, earning his bread by making maps and
charts, for which there was a great and growing demand. About 1470,
having become noted for his skill in such work, he followed his younger
brother Bartholomew to Lisbon,<a id="footnotetag423" name="footnotetag423"></a><a href="#footnote423" title="Go to footnote 423"><span class="small">[423]</span></a> whither Prince Henry's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span>
undertakings had attracted able navigators and learned geographers until
that city had come to be the chief centre of nautical science in Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> Las Casas assures us that Bartholomew was quite equal to
<span class="sidenote">Christopher and Bartholomew at Lisbon.</span>
Christopher as a sailor, and surpassed him in the art of making maps and
globes, as well as in the beauty of his handwriting.<a id="footnotetag424" name="footnotetag424"></a><a href="#footnote424" title="Go to footnote 424"><span class="small">[424]</span></a> In Portugal,
as before in Italy, the work of the brothers Columbus was an alternation
of map-making on land and adventure on the sea. We have Christopher's
own word for it that he sailed with more than one of those Portuguese
expeditions down the African coast;<a id="footnotetag425" name="footnotetag425"></a><a href="#footnote425" title="Go to footnote 425"><span class="small">[425]</span></a> and I think it not altogether
unlikely that he may have been with Santarem and Escobar in their famous
voyage of 1471.</p>

<p>He had not been long in Portugal before he found a wife. We have already
met the able Italian navigator, Bartholomew Perestrelo, who was sent by
Prince Henry to the island of Porto Santo with Zarco and Vaz, about
1425. In recognition of eminent services Prince Henry afterwards, in
1446, <span class="sidenote">Philippa Moñiz de Perestrelo.</span>
appointed him governor of Porto Santo. Perestrelo died in 1457,
leaving a widow (his second wife, Isabella Moñiz) and a charming
daughter Philippa,<a id="footnotetag426" name="footnotetag426"></a><a href="#footnote426" title="Go to footnote 426"><span class="small">[426]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> whom Columbus is said to have first
met at a religious service in the chapel of the convent of All Saints at
Lisbon. From the accounts of his personal appearance, given by Las Casas
and others who knew him, we can well understand how Columbus should have
won the heart of this lady, so far above him at that time in social
position. He was a man of noble and commanding presence, tall and
powerfully built, <span class="sidenote">Personal appearance of Columbus.</span>
with fair ruddy complexion and keen blue-gray eyes
that easily kindled; while his waving white hair must have been quite
picturesque. His manner was at once courteous and cordial and his
conversation charming, so that strangers were quickly won, and in
friends who knew him well he inspired strong affection and respect.<a id="footnotetag427" name="footnotetag427"></a><a href="#footnote427" title="Go to footnote 427"><span class="small">[427]</span></a>
There was an indefinable air of authority about him, as befitted a man
of great heart and lofty thoughts.<a id="footnotetag428" name="footnotetag428"></a><a href="#footnote428" title="Go to footnote 428"><span class="small">[428]</span></a> Out of those kindling eyes
looked a grand and poetic soul, touched with that divine spark of
religious enthusiasm which makes true genius.</p>

<p>The acquaintance between Columbus and Philippa Moñiz de Perestrelo was
not long in ripening into affection, for they were married in 1473. As
there was a small estate at <span class="sidenote">His marriage, and life upon the island of Porto Santo.</span>
Porto Santo, Columbus went home thither with
his bride to live for a while in quiet and seclusion. Such repose we may
believe to have been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> favourable to meditation, and on that
little island, three hundred miles out on the mysterious ocean, we are
told that the great scheme of sailing westward to the Indies first took
shape in the mind of Columbus.<a id="footnotetag429" name="footnotetag429"></a><a href="#footnote429" title="Go to footnote 429"><span class="small">[429]</span></a> His father-in-law Perestrelo had
left a quantity of sailing charts and nautical notes, and these Columbus
diligently studied, while ships on their way to and from Guinea every
now and then stopped at the island, and one can easily imagine the eager
discussions that must have been held over the great commercial problem
of the age,&mdash;how far south that African coast extended and whether there
was any likelihood of ever finding an end to it.</p>

<p>How long Columbus lived upon Porto Santo is not known, but he seems to
have gone from time to time back to Lisbon, and at length to have made
his home&mdash;or in the case of such a rover we might better say his
headquarters&mdash;in that city. We come now to a document of supreme
importance for our narrative. Paolo del Pozzo dei Toscanelli, born at
Florence in 1397, was one of the most famous astronomers and
cosmographers of his time, a man to whom it was natural that questions
involving the size and shape of the earth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span> should be referred.
To him Alfonso V. of Portugal made application, through a gentleman of
the royal household, <span class="sidenote">Alfonso V. asks advice of the great astronomer Toscanelli.</span>
Fernando Martinez, who happened to be an old friend
of Toscanelli. What Alfonso wanted to know was whether there could be a
shorter oceanic route to the Indies than that which his captains were
seeking by following the African coast; if so, he begged that Toscanelli
would explain the nature and direction of such a route. The Florentine
astronomer replied with the letter presently to be quoted in full, dated
June 25, 1474; and along with the letter he sent to the king a sailing
chart, exhibiting his conception of the Atlantic ocean, with Europe on
the east and Cathay on the west. The date of this letter is eloquent. It
was early in 1472 that Santarem and Escobar brought back to Lisbon the
news that beyond the Gold Coast the African shore turned southwards and
stretched away in that direction beyond the equator. As I have already
observed, this was the moment when the question as to the possibility of
a shorter route was likely to arise;<a id="footnotetag430" name="footnotetag430"></a><a href="#footnote430" title="Go to footnote 430"><span class="small">[430]</span></a> and this is precisely the
question we find the king of Portugal putting to Toscanelli some time
before the middle of 1474. Now about this same time, or not long
afterwards, we find Columbus himself appealing to Toscanelli. An aged
Florentine merchant, Lorenzo Giraldi, then settled in Lisbon, was going
back to his native city for a visit, and to him Columbus entrusted a
letter for the eminent astronomer. He received the following answer:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span>
<p>"Paul, the physicist, to Christopher Columbus greeting.<a id="footnotetag431" name="footnotetag431"></a><a href="#footnote431" title="Go to footnote 431"><span class="small">[431]</span></a> I perceive
your great and noble desire to go to the place where the spices grow;
<span class="sidenote">Toscanelli's first letter to Columbus.</span>
wherefore in reply to a letter of yours, I send you a copy of another
letter, which I wrote a few days ago [or some time ago] to a friend of
mine, a gentleman of the household of the most gracious king of Portugal
before the wars of Castile,<a id="footnotetag432" name="footnotetag432"></a><a href="#footnote432" title="Go to footnote 432"><span class="small">[432]</span></a> in reply to another, which by command
of His Highness he wrote me concerning that matter: and I send you
another sailing chart, similar to the one I sent him, by which your
demands will be satisfied. The copy of that letter of mine is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Paul, the physicist, to Fernando Martinez, canon, at Lisbon,
greeting.<a id="footnotetag433" name="footnotetag433"></a><a href="#footnote433" title="Go to footnote 433"><span class="small">[433]</span></a> I was glad to hear <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> of your intimacy and favour
with your most noble and illustrious king.
<span class="sidenote">Toscanelli's copy of his former letter to Martinez&mdash;enclosed
in his first letter to Columbus.</span>
I have formerly spoken with
you about a shorter route to the places of Spices by ocean navigation
than that which you are pursuing by Guinea. The most gracious king now
desires from me some statement, or rather an exhibition to the eye, so
that even slightly educated persons can grasp and comprehend that route.
Although I am well aware that this can be proved from the spherical
shape of the earth, nevertheless, in order to make the point clearer and
to facilitate the enterprise, I have decided to exhibit that route by
means of a sailing chart. I therefore send to his majesty a chart made
by my own hands,<a id="footnotetag434" name="footnotetag434"></a><a href="#footnote434" title="Go to footnote 434"><span class="small">[434]</span></a> upon which are laid down your coasts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> the islands from which you must begin to shape your course
steadily westward, and the places at which you are bound to arrive, and
how far from the pole or from the equator you ought to keep away, and
through how much space or through how many miles you are to arrive at
places most fertile in all sorts of spices and gems; and do not wonder
at my calling <i>west</i> the parts where the spices are, whereas they are
commonly called <i>east</i>, because to persons sailing persistently westward
those parts will be found by courses on the under side of the earth. For
if [you go] by land and by routes on this upper side, they will always
be found in the east. The straight lines drawn lengthwise upon the map
indicate distance from east to west, while the transverse lines show
distances from south to north. I have drawn upon the map various places
upon which you may come, for the better information of the navigators in
case of their arriving, whether through accident of wind or what not, at
some different place from what they had expected; but partly in order
that they may show the inhabitants that they have some knowledge of
their country, which is sure to be a pleasant thing. It is said that
none but merchants dwell in the islands.<a id="footnotetag435" name="footnotetag435"></a><a href="#footnote435" title="Go to footnote 435"><span class="small">[435]</span></a> For so great there is the
number of navigators with their merchandise that in all the rest of the
world there are not so many as in one very splendid port called

residence is for the most part in the province of Cathay. His

of cities on the banks of the rivers, such that on one river there are
about two hundred cities, with marble bridges very long and wide and
everywhere adorned with columns. This country is worth seeking by the
Latins, not only because great treasures may be obtained from it,&mdash;gold,
silver, and all sorts of jewels and spices,&mdash;but on account of its
learned men, philosophers, and skilled astrologers, and [in order that
we may see] with what arts and devices so powerful and splendid a
province is governed, and also [how] they conduct their wars. This for

the city of Lisbon due west there are 26 spaces marked on the
map, <span class="sidenote">Conclusion of Toscanelli's first letter to Columbus.</span>
each of which contains 250 miles, as far as the very great and
splendid city of Quinsay.<a id="footnotetag440" name="footnotetag440"></a><a href="#footnote440" title="Go to footnote 440"><span class="small">[440]</span></a> For it is a hundred miles in

Cathay in which land is the royal residence. But from the island of

pearls, and precious stones, and they cover the temples and palaces with
solid gold. So through the unknown parts of the route the stretches of

stated more clearly, but one who duly considers what I have said will be
able to work out the rest for himself. Farewell, most esteemed one."</p>

<p>Some time after the receipt of this letter Columbus wrote again to
Toscanelli, apparently sending him either some charts of his own, or
some notes, or something bearing upon the subject in hand. No such
letter is preserved, but Toscanelli replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Paul, the physicist, to Christopher Columbus greeting.<a id="footnotetag442" name="footnotetag442"></a><a href="#footnote442" title="Go to footnote 442"><span class="small">[442]</span></a> I have
received your letters, with the things which you sent me, for which I
thank you very much. <span class="sidenote">Toscanelli's second letter to Columbus.</span>
I regard as noble and grand your project of sailing
from east to west according to the indications furnished by the map
which I sent you, and which would appear still more plainly upon a
sphere. I am much pleased to see that I have been well understood, and
that the voyage has become not only possible <span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> but certain,<a id="footnotetag443" name="footnotetag443"></a><a href="#footnote443" title="Go to footnote 443"><span class="small">[443]</span></a>
fraught with honour as it must be, and inestimable gain, and most lofty
fame among all Christian people. You cannot take in all that it means
except by actual experience, or without such copious and accurate
information as I have had from eminent and learned men who have come
from those places to the Roman court, and from merchants who have traded
a long time in those parts, persons whose word is to be believed
(<i>persone di grande autorità</i>). When that voyage shall be accomplished,
it will be a voyage to powerful kingdoms, and to cities and provinces
most wealthy and noble, abounding in all sorts of things most desired by
us; I mean, with all kinds of spices and jewels in great abundance. It
will also be advantageous for those kings and princes who are eager to
have dealings and make alliances with the Christians of our countries,
and to learn from the erudite men of these parts,<a id="footnotetag444" name="footnotetag444"></a><a href="#footnote444" title="Go to footnote 444"><span class="small">[444]</span></a> as well in
religion as in all other branches of knowledge. For these reasons, and
many others that might be mentioned, I do not wonder that you, who are
of great courage, and the whole Portuguese nation, which has always had
men distinguished in all such enterprises, are now inflamed with
desire<a id="footnotetag445" name="footnotetag445"></a><a href="#footnote445" title="Go to footnote 445"><span class="small">[445]</span></a> to execute the said voyage."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span>

<p>These letters are intensely interesting, especially the one to Martinez,
which reveals the fact that as early as 1474 the notion that a westward
route to the Indies would be shorter than the southward route had
somehow been suggested to Alfonso V.; <span class="sidenote">Who first suggested the feasibleness of a westward
route? Was it Columbus?</span>
and had, moreover, sufficiently
arrested his attention to lead him to make inquiries of the most eminent
astronomer within reach. Who could have suggested this notion to the
king of Portugal? Was it Columbus, the trained mariner and map-maker,
who might lately have been pondering the theories of Ptolemy and Mela as
affected by the voyage of Santarem and Escobar, and whose connection
with the Moñiz and Perestrelo families would now doubtless facilitate
his access to the court? On some accounts this may seem probable,
especially if we bear in mind Columbus's own statement implying that his
appeals to the crown dated almost from the beginning of his fourteen
years in Portugal.</p>

<p>All the circumstances, however, seem to be equally consistent with the
hypothesis that the first suggestion of the <span class="sidenote">Perhaps it was Toscanelli.</span>
westward route may have come
from Toscanelli himself, through the medium of the canon Martinez, who
had for so many years been a member of King Alfonso's household. The
words at the beginning of the letter lend some probability to this view:
"I have formerly spoken with you about a shorter route to the places of
Spices by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span> ocean navigation than that which you are pursuing by
Guinea." It was accordingly earlier than 1474&mdash;how much earlier does not
appear&mdash;that such discussions between Toscanelli and Martinez must
probably have come to the ears of King Alfonso; and now, very likely
owing to the voyage of Santarem and Escobar, that monarch began to think
it worth while to seek for further information, "an exhibition to the
eye," so that mariners not learned in astronomy like Toscanelli might
"grasp and comprehend" the shorter route suggested. It is altogether
probable that the Florentine astronomer, who was seventy-seven years old
when he wrote this letter, had already for a long time entertained the
idea of a westward route; and a man in whom the subject aroused so much
enthusiasm could hardly have been reticent about it. It is not likely
that Martinez was the only person to whom he descanted<a id="footnotetag446" name="footnotetag446"></a><a href="#footnote446" title="Go to footnote 446"><span class="small">[446]</span></a> upon the
glory <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span> and riches to be found by sailing "straight to Cathay,"
and there were many channels through which Columbus might have got some
inkling of his views, even before going to Portugal.</p>

<p>However this may have been, the letter clearly proves that at that most
interesting period, in or about 1474, Columbus was already meditating
upon the westward route.<a id="footnotetag447" name="footnotetag447"></a><a href="#footnote447" title="Go to footnote 447"><span class="small">[447]</span></a> Whether he owed the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span> idea to
Toscanelli, or not, is a question of no great <span class="sidenote">The idea was suggested by the globular form of the earth;</span>
importance so far as
concerns his own originality; for the idea was already in the air. The
originality of Columbus did not consist in his conceiving the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span>
possibility of reaching the shores of Cathay by sailing west, but in his
conceiving it in such distinct <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span> and practical shape as to be
ready to make the adventure in his own person. As a matter of theory the
possibility of such a voyage could not fail to be suggested by the
globular form of the earth; and ever since the days of Aristotle that
had been generally admitted by men learned in physical science.
Aristotle proved, from the different altitudes of the pole-star in
different places, that the earth must necessarily be a globe. Moreover,
says Aristotle, "some stars are seen in Egypt or at Cyprus, but are not
seen in the countries to the north of these; and the stars that in the
north are visible while they make a complete circuit, there undergo a
setting. So that from this it is manifest, not only that the form of the
earth is round, but also that it is part of not a very large sphere; for
otherwise the difference would not be so obvious to persons making so
small a change of place. Wherefore we may judge that <i>those persons who
connect the region in the neighbourhood of the Pillars of Hercules with
that towards India, and who assert that in this way the sea is</i> <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, do
not assert things very improbable."<a id="footnotetag448" name="footnotetag448"></a><a href="#footnote448" title="Go to footnote 448"><span class="small">[448]</span></a> It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span> thus appears that
more than eighteen centuries before <span class="sidenote">and was as old as Aristotle.</span>
Columbus took counsel of Toscanelli,
"those persons" to whom Aristotle alludes were discussing, as a matter
of theory, this same subject. Eratosthenes held that it would be easy
enough to sail from Spain to India on the same parallel were it not for
the vast extent of the Atlantic ocean.<a id="footnotetag449" name="footnotetag449"></a><a href="#footnote449" title="Go to footnote 449"><span class="small">[449]</span></a> On the other hand, Seneca
maintained that the distance was probably not so very great, and that
with favouring winds a ship might make the voyage in a few days.<a id="footnotetag450" name="footnotetag450"></a><a href="#footnote450" title="Go to footnote 450"><span class="small">[450]</span></a> In
one of his tragedies Seneca has a striking passage<a id="footnotetag451" name="footnotetag451"></a><a href="#footnote451" title="Go to footnote 451"><span class="small">[451]</span></a> which has been
repeatedly quoted as referring to the discovery of America, and is
certainly one of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span> the most notable instances of prophecy on
record. There will come a time, he says, in the later years, when Ocean
shall loosen the bonds by which we have been confined, when an immense
land shall lie revealed, and <span class="sidenote">Opinions of ancient writers.</span>
Tethys shall disclose new worlds, and Thule
will no longer be the most remote of countries. In Strabo there is a
passage, less commonly noticed, which hits the truth&mdash;as we know it
to-day&mdash;even more closely. Having argued that the total length of the
Inhabited World is only about a third part of the circumference of the
earth in the temperate zone, he suggests it as possible, or even
probable, that within this space there may be another Inhabited World,
or even more than one; but such places would be inhabited by different
races of men, with whom the geographer, whose task it is to describe the
<i>known</i> world, has no concern.<a id="footnotetag452" name="footnotetag452"></a><a href="#footnote452" title="Go to footnote 452"><span class="small">[452]</span></a> Nothing could better illustrate the
philosophical character of Strabo's mind. In such speculations, so far
as his means of verification went, he was situated somewhat as we are
to-day with regard to the probable inhabitants of Venus or Mars.</p>

<p>Early in the Christian era we are told by an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>(p. 371)</span> eminent Greek
astronomer that the doctrine of the earth's sphericity was accepted by
all competent persons except the Epicureans.<a id="footnotetag453" name="footnotetag453"></a><a href="#footnote453" title="Go to footnote 453"><span class="small">[453]</span></a> Among the Fathers of
the Church there was some difference of opinion; while in general they
<span class="sidenote">Opinions of Christian writers.</span>
denied the existence of human beings beyond the limits of their
&OElig;cumene, or Inhabited World, this denial did not necessarily involve
disbelief in the globular figure of the earth.<a id="footnotetag454" name="footnotetag454"></a><a href="#footnote454" title="Go to footnote 454"><span class="small">[454]</span></a> The views of the
great mass of people, and of the more ignorant of the clergy, down to
the time of Columbus, were probably well represented in the book of
Cosmas Indicopleustes already cited.<a id="footnotetag455" name="footnotetag455"></a><a href="#footnote455" title="Go to footnote 455"><span class="small">[455]</span></a> Nevertheless among the more
enlightened clergy the views of the ancient astronomers were never quite
forgotten, and in the great revival of intellectual life in the
thirteenth century the doctrine of the earth's sphericity was again
brought prominently into the foreground. We find Dante basing upon it
the cosmical theory elaborated in his immortal poem.<a id="footnotetag456" name="footnotetag456"></a><a href="#footnote456" title="Go to footnote 456"><span class="small">[456]</span></a>
In 1267 <span class="sidenote">Roger Bacon.</span>
Roger
Bacon&mdash;stimulated, no doubt, by the reports of the ocean east of
Cathay&mdash;collected passages from ancient writers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span> to prove that
the distance from Spain to the eastern shores of Asia could not be very
great. Bacon's argument and citations were copied in an extremely
curious book, the "Imago Mundi," published in 1410 by the Cardinal
Pierre d'Ailly, Bishop of Cambrai, better known by the Latinized form of
his name as <span class="sidenote">The "Imago Mundi" of Petrus Alliacus.</span>
Petrus Alliacus. This treatise, which throughout the
fifteenth century enjoyed a great reputation, was a favourite book with
Columbus, and his copy of it, covered with marginal annotations in his
own handwriting, is still preserved among the priceless treasures of the
Biblioteca Colombina.<a id="footnotetag457" name="footnotetag457"></a><a href="#footnote457" title="Go to footnote 457"><span class="small">[457]</span></a> He found in it strong confirmation of his
views, and it is not impossible that the reading of it may have first
put such ideas into his head. Such a point, however, can hardly be
determined. As I have already observed, these ideas were in the air.
What Columbus did was not to originate them, but to incarnate them in
facts and breathe into them the breath of life. It was one thing to
suggest, as a theoretical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span> possibility, that Cathay might be
reached by sailing westward; and it was quite another thing to prove
that the enterprise was feasible with the ships and instruments then at
command.</p>

<p>Annotations by Columbus.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal consideration, of course, was the distance to be
traversed; and here Columbus was helped by an error which he shared with
many geographers of his day. He somewhat underestimated the size of the
earth, and at the same time greatly overestimated the length of Asia.
The first astronomer to calculate, by scientific methods, the
circumference of our planet at the equator was <span class="sidenote">Ancient estimates of the size of the globe and the length of
the &OElig;cumene.</span>
Eratosthenes (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span>
276-196), and he came&mdash;all things considered&mdash;fairly near the truth; he
made it 25,200 geographical miles (of ten stadia), or about one seventh
too great. The true figure is 21,600 geographical miles, equivalent to
24,899 English statute miles.<a id="footnotetag458" name="footnotetag458"></a><a href="#footnote458" title="Go to footnote 458"><span class="small">[458]</span></a> Curiously enough, Posidonius, in
revising this calculation a century later, reduced the figure to 18,000
miles, or about one seventh too small. The circumference in the latitude
of Gibraltar he estimated at 14,000 miles; the length of the &OElig;cumene,
or Inhabited World, he called 7,000; the distance across the Atlantic
from the Spanish strand to the eastern shores of Asia was the other
7,000. The error of Posidonius was partially rectified by Ptolemy, who
made the equatorial circumference 20,400 geographical miles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span> the length of a degree 56.6 miles.<a id="footnotetag459" name="footnotetag459"></a><a href="#footnote459" title="Go to footnote 459"><span class="small">[459]</span></a> This estimate, in
which the error was less than one sixteenth, prevailed until modern
times. Ptolemy also supposed the Inhabited World to extend over about
half the circumference of the temperate zone, but the other half he
imagined as consisting largely of bad lands, quagmires, and land-locked
seas, instead of a vast and open ocean.<a id="footnotetag460" name="footnotetag460"></a><a href="#footnote460" title="Go to footnote 460"><span class="small">[460]</span></a></p>

<p>Ptolemy's opinion as to the length of the Inhabited World was
considerably modified in the minds of those writers who toward the end
of the Middle Ages had been strongly impressed by the book of Marco
Polo. Among these persons was Toscanelli. <span class="sidenote">Toscanelli's calculation of the size of the earth,</span>
This excellent astronomer
calculated the earth's equatorial circumference at almost exactly the
true figure; his error was less than 124 English miles in excess. The
circumference in the latitude of Lisbon he made 26 × 250 × 3 = 19,500
miles.<a id="footnotetag461" name="footnotetag461"></a><a href="#footnote461" title="Go to footnote 461"><span class="small">[461]</span></a> Two thirds of this figure, or 13,000 miles, he allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span> for the length of the &OElig;cumene, from Lisbon eastward to
Quinsay (i. e. Hang-chow), leaving 6,500 for the westward voyage from
Lisbon to Quinsay. Thus Toscanelli elongated Asia by nearly the whole
width of the Pacific ocean. His Quinsay would come about 130° W., a few
hundred miles west of the mouth of the Columbia river. Zaiton (i. e.
Chang-chow), the easternmost city in Toscanelli's China, would come not
far from the tip end of Lower California. Thus the eastern coast of
<span class="sidenote">and of the position of Cipango.</span>
Cipango, about a thousand miles east from Zaiton, would fall in the Gulf
of Mexico somewhere near the ninety-third meridian, and that island,
being over a thousand miles in length north and south, would fill up the
space between the parallel of New Orleans and that of the city of
Guatemala. The westward voyage from the Canaries to Cipango, according
to Toscanelli, would be rather more than 3,250 miles, but at a third of
the distance out he placed the imaginary island of "Antilia," with which
he seems to have supposed Portuguese sailors to be familiar.<a id="footnotetag462" name="footnotetag462"></a><a href="#footnote462" title="Go to footnote 462"><span class="small">[462]</span></a> "So
through the unknown parts of the route," said the venerable astronomer,
"the stretches of sea to be traversed are not great,"&mdash;not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span>
much more than 2,000 English miles, not so long as the voyage from
Lisbon to the Guinea coast.</p>

<p>While Columbus attached great importance to these calculations and
carried Toscanelli's map with him upon his first voyage, he improved
somewhat upon the estimates of distance, and thus made his case still
more hopeful. <span class="sidenote">Columbus's opinion of the size of the globe, the length of
the &OElig;cumene, and the width of the Atlantic ocean.</span>
Columbus was not enough of an astronomer to adopt
Toscanelli's improved measurement of the size of the earth. He accepted
Ptolemy's figure of 20,400 geographical miles for the equatorial
girth,<a id="footnotetag463" name="footnotetag463"></a><a href="#footnote463" title="Go to footnote 463"><span class="small">[463]</span></a> which would make the circumference in the latitude of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>(p. 378)</span> the Canaries about 18,000; and Columbus, on the strength of
sundry passages from ancient authors which he found in Alliacus (cribbed
from Roger Bacon), concluded that six sevenths of this circumference
must be occupied by the &OElig;cumene, including Cipango, so that in order
to reach that wonderful island he would only have to sail over one
seventh, or not much more than 2,500 miles from the Canaries.<a id="footnotetag464" name="footnotetag464"></a><a href="#footnote464" title="Go to footnote 464"><span class="small">[464]</span></a> An
authority upon which he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>(p. 379)</span> placed great reliance in this
connection was the fourth book of <span class="sidenote">The fourth book of Esdras.</span>
Esdras, which although not a canonical
part of the Bible was approved by holy men, and which expressly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span> asserted that six parts of the earth (i. e. of the length of
the &OElig;cumene, or north temperate zone) are inhabited and only the
seventh part covered with water. From the general habit of Columbus's
mind it may be inferred that it was chiefly upon this scriptural
authority that he based his confident expectation of finding land soon
after accomplishing seven hundred leagues from the Canaries. Was it not
as good as written in the Bible that land was to be found there?</p>

<p>Thus did Columbus arrive at his decisive conclusion, estimating the
distance across the Sea of Darkness to Japan at something less than the
figure which actually expresses the distance to the West Indies. Many a
hopeful enterprise has been ruined by errors in figuring, but this wrong
calculation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>(p. 381)</span> was certainly a great help to Columbus.
<span class="sidenote">Fortunate mixture of truth and error.</span>
When we
consider how difficult he found it to obtain men and ships for a voyage
supposed to be not more than 2,500 miles in this new and untried
direction, we must admit that his chances would have been poor indeed if
he had proposed to sail westward on the Sea of Darkness for nearly
12,000 miles, the real distance from the Canaries to Japan. It was a
case where the littleness of the knowledge was not a dangerous but a
helpful thing. If instead of the somewhat faulty astronomy of Ptolemy
and the very hazy notions prevalent about "the Indies," the correct
astronomy of Toscanelli had prevailed and had been joined to an accurate
knowledge of eastern Asia, Columbus would surely never have conceived
his great scheme, and the discovery of America would probably have
waited to be made by accident.<a id="footnotetag465" name="footnotetag465"></a><a href="#footnote465" title="Go to footnote 465"><span class="small">[465]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">The whole point and purport of Columbus's scheme.</span>
The whole point of his scheme lay in
its promise of a shorter route to the Indies than that which the
Portuguese were seeking by way of Guinea. Unless it was probable that it
could furnish such a shorter route, there was no reason for such an
extraordinary enterprise.</p>

<hr>

<p>The years between 1474 and 1480 were not favourable for new maritime
ventures on the part of the Portuguese government. The war with Castile
absorbed the energies of Alfonso V. as well as his money, and he was
badly beaten into the bargain. About this time Columbus was writing a
treatise <span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span> on "the five habitable zones," intended to refute the
<span class="sidenote">Columbus's speculations on climate.</span>
old notions about regions so fiery or so frozen as to be inaccessible to
man. As this book is lost we know little or nothing of its views and
speculations, but it appears that in writing it Columbus utilized sundry
observations made by himself in long voyages into the torrid and arctic
zones. <span class="sidenote">His voyage to Guinea.</span>
He spent some time at the fortress of San Jorge de la Mina, on
the Gold Coast, and made a study of that equinoctial climate.<a id="footnotetag466" name="footnotetag466"></a><a href="#footnote466" title="Go to footnote 466"><span class="small">[466]</span></a> This
could not have been earlier than 1482, the year in which the fortress
was built. Five years before this he seems to have gone far in the
opposite direction. In a fragment of a letter or diary, preserved by his
son and by Las Casas, <span class="sidenote">His voyage into the Arctic ocean, 1477.</span>
he says:&mdash;"In the month of February, 1477, I
sailed a hundred leagues beyond the island of Thule, [to?] an island of
which the south part is in latitude 73°, not 63°, as some say; and it
[i. e. Thule] does not lie within Ptolemy's western boundary, but much
farther west. And to this island, which is as big as England, the
English go with their wares, especially from Bristol. When I was there
the sea was not frozen. In some places the tide rose and fell twenty-six
fathoms. It is true that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy lies where he
says it does, and this by the moderns is called Frislanda."<a id="footnotetag467" name="footnotetag467"></a><a href="#footnote467" title="Go to footnote 467"><span class="small">[467]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>(p. 383)</span>

<p>Taken as it stands this passage is so bewildering that we can hardly
suppose it to have come in just this shape from the pen of Columbus. It
looks as if it had been abridged from some diary of his by some person
unfamiliar with the Arctic seas; and I have ventured to insert in
brackets a little preposition which may perhaps help to straighten out
the meaning. By Thule Columbus doubtless means Iceland, which lies
between latitudes 64° and 67°, and it looks as if he meant to say that
he ran beyond it as far as the little island, just a hundred leagues
from Iceland and in <span class="sidenote">He may have reached Jan Mayen island,</span>
latitude 71°, since discovered by Jan Mayen in 1611.
The rest of the paragraph is more intelligible. It is true that Iceland
lies thirty degrees farther west than Ptolemy placed Thule; and that for
a century before the discovery of the Newfoundland fisheries the English
did much fishing in the waters about Iceland, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span> and carried
wares thither, especially from Bristol.<a id="footnotetag468" name="footnotetag468"></a><a href="#footnote468" title="Go to footnote 468"><span class="small">[468]</span></a> There can be no doubt that
by Frislanda Columbus means the Færoe <span class="sidenote">and stopped at Iceland.</span>
islands,<a id="footnotetag469" name="footnotetag469"></a><a href="#footnote469" title="Go to footnote 469"><span class="small">[469]</span></a> which do lie in the
latitude though not in the longitude mentioned by Ptolemy. As for the
voyage into the Jan Mayen waters in February, it would be dangerous but
by no means impossible.<a id="footnotetag470" name="footnotetag470"></a><a href="#footnote470" title="Go to footnote 470"><span class="small">[470]</span></a> In another letter Columbus mentions
visiting England, apparently in connection with this voyage,<a id="footnotetag471" name="footnotetag471"></a><a href="#footnote471" title="Go to footnote 471"><span class="small">[471]</span></a> and it
is highly probable that he went in an English ship from Bristol.</p>

<p>The object of Columbus in making these long voyages to the equator and
into the polar circle was, as he tells us, to gather observations upon
climate. From the circumstance of his having made a stop at some point
in Iceland, it was conjectured by Finn Magnusson
<span class="sidenote">The hypothesis that Columbus "must have" heard and understood
the story of the Vinland voyages.</span>
that Columbus might
have learned something about Vinland which served to guide him to his
own enterprise or to encourage him in it. Starting from this suggestion,
it has been argued<a id="footnotetag472" name="footnotetag472"></a><a href="#footnote472" title="Go to footnote 472"><span class="small">[472]</span></a> that Columbus must have read the geographical
appendix to Adam of Bremen's "Ecclesiastical History;" that he must
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>(p. 385)</span> have understood, as we now do, the reference therein made to
Vinland; that he made his voyage to Iceland in order to obtain further
information; that he there not only heard about Vinland and other
localities mentioned in the sagas, but also mentally placed them about
where they were placed in 1837 by Professor Rafn; that, among other
things, he thus obtained a correct knowledge of the width of the
Atlantic ocean in latitude 28° N.; and that during fifteen subsequent
years of weary endeavour to obtain ships and men for his westward
voyage, he sedulously refrained from using the most convincing argument
at his command,&mdash;namely that land of continental dimensions had actually
been found (though by a very different route) in the direction which he
indicated.</p>

<p>I have already given an explanation of the process by which Columbus
arrived at the firm belief that by sailing not more than about 2,500
geographical miles due west from the Canaries he should reach the coast
of Japan. Every step of that explanation is sustained by documentary
evidence, and as his belief is thus completely accounted for, the
hypothesis that he may have based it upon information obtained in
Iceland is, to say the least, superfluous. We do not need it in order to
explain his actions, and accordingly his actions do not afford a
presumption in favour of it. <span class="sidenote">That hypothesis has no evidence in its favour.</span>
There is otherwise no reason, of course,
for refusing to admit that he might have obtained information in
Iceland, were there any evidence that he did. But not a scrap <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>(p. 386)</span>
of such evidence has ever been produced. Every step in the Scandinavian
hypothesis is a pure assumption.</p>

<p>First it is assumed that Columbus <i>must</i> have read the appendix to Adam
of Bremen's history. But really, while it is not impossible that he
should have read that <span class="sidenote">It is not probable that Columbus knew of Adam of Bremen's
allusion to Vinland,</span>
document, it is, on the whole, improbable. The
appendix was first printed in Lindenbrog's edition, published at Leyden,
in 1595. The eminent Norwegian historian, Gustav Storm, finds that in
the sixteenth century just six MSS. of Adam's works can now be traced.
Of these, two were preserved in Denmark, two in Hamburg, one had
<i>perhaps</i> already wandered southward to Leyden, and one as far as
<span class="sidenote">or that he would have understood it if he had read it.</span>
Vienna. Dr. Storm, therefore, feels sure that Columbus never saw Adam's
mention of Vinland, and pithily adds that "had Columbus known it, it
would not have been able to show him the way to the West Indies, but
perhaps to the North Pole."<a id="footnotetag473" name="footnotetag473"></a><a href="#footnote473" title="Go to footnote 473"><span class="small">[473]</span></a> From the account of this mention and
its context, which I have already given,<a id="footnotetag474" name="footnotetag474"></a><a href="#footnote474" title="Go to footnote 474"><span class="small">[474]</span></a> it is in the highest
degree improbable that if Columbus had read the passage he could have
understood it as bearing upon his own problem. There is, therefore, no
ground for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387"></a>(p. 387)</span> assumption that Columbus went to Iceland in
order to make inquiries about Vinland.</p>

<p>It may be argued that even if he did not go for such a purpose,
nevertheless when once there he could hardly have failed incidentally to
get the information. This, however, is not at all clear. Observe that
our sole authority for the journey to Iceland is the passage above
quoted at second-hand from Columbus himself; and there is nothing in it
to show whether he staid a <span class="sidenote">It is doubtful if Columbus would have stumbled upon the story
in Iceland.</span>
few hours or several weeks ashore, or met
with any one likely to be possessed of the knowledge in question. The
absence of any reference to Vinland in the Zeno narrative is an
indication that the memory of it had faded away before 1400, and it was
not distinctly and generally revived until the time of Torfæus in
1705.<a id="footnotetag475" name="footnotetag475"></a><a href="#footnote475" title="Go to footnote 475"><span class="small">[475]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>(p. 388)</span>

<p>But to hear about Vinland was one thing, to be guided by it to Japan was
quite another affair. It was not the mention of timber and peltries and
Skrælings that would fire the imagination of Columbus; his dreams were
of stately cities with busy wharves where ships were laden with silks
and jewels, and of <span class="sidenote">If he had heard it, he would probably have classed
it with such tales as that of St. Brandan's isle.</span>
Oriental magnates decked out with "barbaric pearl and
gold," dwelling in pavilions of marble and jasper amid flowery gardens
in "a summer fanned with spice." The mention of Vinland was no more
likely to excite Columbus's attention than that of St. Brandan's isle or
other places supposed to lie in the western ocean. He was after higher
game.</p>

<p>To suppose that Columbus, even had he got hold of the Saga of Eric the
Red and conned it from beginning to end, with a learned interpreter at
his elbow, could have gained from it a knowledge of the width of the
<span class="sidenote">He could not have obtained from such a source his opinion of
the width of the ocean.</span>
Atlantic ocean, is simply preposterous. It would be impossible to
extract any such knowledge from that document to-day without the aid of
our modern maps. The most diligent critical study of all the Icelandic
sources of information, with all the resources of modern scholarship,
enables us with some confidence to place Vinland somewhere between Cape
Breton and Point Judith, that is to say, somewhere between two points
distant from each other more than four degrees in latitude and more than
eleven degrees in longitude! When we have got thus far, knowing as we do
that the coast in question belongs <span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>(p. 389)</span> to the same continental
system as the West Indies, we can look at our map and pick up our pair
of compasses and measure the width of the ocean at the twenty-eighth
parallel. But it is not the mediæval document, but our modern map that
guides us to this knowledge. And yet it is innocently assumed that
Columbus, without any knowledge or suspicion of the existence of
America, and from such vague data concerning voyages made five hundred
years before his time, by men who had no means of reckoning latitude and
longitude, could have obtained his figure of 2,500 miles for the voyage
from the Canaries to Japan!<a id="footnotetag476" name="footnotetag476"></a><a href="#footnote476" title="Go to footnote 476"><span class="small">[476]</span></a> The fallacy here is that which
underlies the whole Scandinavian hypothesis and many other fanciful
geographical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span> speculations. It is the fallacy of projecting our
present knowledge into the past.</p>

<p>We have next to inquire, if Columbus had heard of Vinland and
comprehended its relation to his own theory about land at the west, why
in the world should he have <span class="sidenote">If he had known and understood the Vinland story, he had the
strongest motives for proclaiming it and no motive for concealing it.</span>
concealed this valuable knowledge? The
notion seems to be that he must have kept it secret through an unworthy
desire to claim a priority in discovery to which he knew that he was not
entitled.<a id="footnotetag477" name="footnotetag477"></a><a href="#footnote477" title="Go to footnote 477"><span class="small">[477]</span></a> This is projecting our present knowledge into the past
with a vengeance. Columbus never professed to have discovered America;
he died in the belief that what he had done was to reach the eastern
shores of Asia by a shorter route than the Portuguese. If he had reason
to suppose that the Northmen had once come down from the Arctic seas to
some unknown part of the Asiatic coast, he had no motive for concealing
such a fact, but the strongest of motives for proclaiming it, inasmuch
as it would have given him the kind of inductive argument which he
sorely needed. The chief obstacle for Columbus was that for want of
tangible evidence he was obliged to appeal to men's reason with
scientific arguments. When you show things to young children they are
not content with looking; they crave a more intimate acquaintance than
the eyes alone can give, and so they reach out and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span> handle the
things. So when ideas are presented to grown-up men, they are apt to be
unwilling to trust to the eye of reason until it has been supplemented
by the eye of sense; and indeed in most affairs of life such caution is
wholesome. The difference between Columbus and many of the "practical"
men whom he sought to convince was that he could see with his mind's eye
solid land beyond the Sea of Darkness while they could not. To them the
ocean, like the sky, had nothing beyond, unless it might be the
supernatural world.<a id="footnotetag478" name="footnotetag478"></a><a href="#footnote478" title="Go to footnote 478"><span class="small">[478]</span></a> For while the argument from the earth's
rotundity was intelligible enough, there were few to whom, as to
Toscanelli, it was a living truth. Even of those who admitted, in
theory, that Cathay lay to the west of Europe, most deemed the distance
untraversable. Inductive proof of the existence of accessible land to
the west was thus what Columbus chiefly needed, and what he sought every
opportunity to find and produce; but it was not easy to find anything
more substantial than sailors' vague mention of driftwood of foreign
aspect or other outlandish jetsam washed up on the Portuguese
strand.<a id="footnotetag479" name="footnotetag479"></a><a href="#footnote479" title="Go to footnote 479"><span class="small">[479]</span></a> What a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span> godsend it would have been for Columbus if
he could have had the Vinland business to hurl at the heads of his
adversaries! If he could have said, "Five hundred years ago some
Icelanders coasted westward in the polar regions, and then coasted
southward until they reached a country beyond the ocean and about
opposite to France or Portugal; therefore that country must be Asia, and
I can reach it by striking boldly across the ocean, which will obviously
be shorter than going down by Guinea,"&mdash;if he could have said this, he
would have had precisely the unanswerable argument for lack of which his
case was waiting and suffering. In persuading men to furnish hard cash,
for his commercial enterprise, as Colonel Higginson so neatly says, "an
ounce of Vinland would have been worth a pound of cosmography."<a id="footnotetag480" name="footnotetag480"></a><a href="#footnote480" title="Go to footnote 480"><span class="small">[480]</span></a> We
may be sure that the silence of Columbus about the Norse voyages proves
that he knew nothing about them or quite failed to see their bearings
upon his own undertaking. It seems to me absolutely decisive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this silence is in harmony with the fact that in none of
his four voyages across the Atlantic did Columbus betray any
consciousness that there was anything for him to gain by steering toward
the northwest. If he could correctly have conceived the position of
Vinland he surely would not have conceived it as south of the fortieth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span> parallel. On his first voyage he steered due west in latitude
<span class="sidenote">No trace of a thought of Vinland appears in the voyages of
Columbus.</span>
28° because Toscanelli placed Japan opposite the Canaries. When at
length some doubts began to arise and he altered his course, as we shall
hereafter see, the change was toward the southwest. His first two
voyages did not reveal to him the golden cities for which he was
looking, and when on his third and fourth voyages he tried a different
course it was farther toward the equator, not farther away from it, that
he turned his prows. Not the slightest trace of a thought of Vinland
appears in anything that he did.</p>

<p>Finally it may be asked, if the memory of Vinland was such a living
thing in Iceland in 1477 that a visitor would be likely to be told about
it, why was it not sufficiently alive in
<span class="sidenote">Why did not Norway or Iceland utter a protest in 1493?</span>
1493 to call forth a protest
from the North? When the pope, as we shall presently see, was
proclaiming to the world that the Spanish crown was entitled to all
heathen lands and islands already discovered or to be discovered in the
ocean west of the Azores, why did not some zealous Scandinavian at once
jump up and cry out, "Look here, old Columbus, <i>we</i> discovered that
western route, you know! Stop thief!" Why was it necessary to wait more
than a hundred years longer before the affair of Vinland was mentioned
in this connection?</p>

<p>Simply because it was not until the seventeenth century that the
knowledge of North American geography had reached such a stage of
completeness as to suggest to anybody the true significance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span> of
the old voyages from Greenland. That significance could not have been
understood by Leif and Thorfinn themselves, or by the compilers of
Hauks-bók and Flateyar-bók, or by any human being, until about the time
of <span class="sidenote">The idea of Vinland was not associated with the idea of
America until the seventeenth century.</span>
Henry Hudson. Not earlier than that time should we expect to find it
mentioned, and it is just then, in 1610, that we do find it mentioned by
Arngrim Jonsson, who calls Vinland "an island of <i>America</i>, in the
region of Greenland, perhaps the modern Estotilandia."<a id="footnotetag481" name="footnotetag481"></a><a href="#footnote481" title="Go to footnote 481"><span class="small">[481]</span></a> This is the
earliest glimmering of an association of the idea of Vinland with that
of America.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span>

<p>The genesis of the grand scheme of Columbus has now been set forth, I
believe, with sufficient fulness. The cardinal facts are 1, that the
need for some such scheme was suggested in <span class="sidenote">Résumé of the genesis of Columbus's scheme.</span>
1471, by the discovery that
the Guinea coast extended south of the equator; 2, that by 1474 advice
had been sought from Toscanelli by the king of Portugal, and not very
long after 1474 by Columbus; 3, that upon Toscanelli's letters and map,
amended by the Ptolemaic estimate of the earth's size and by the
authority of passages quoted in the book of Alliacus (one of which was a
verse from the Apocrypha), Columbus based his firm conviction of the
feasibleness of the western route. How or by whom the suggestion of that
route was first made&mdash;whether by Columbus himself or by Toscanelli or by
Fernando Martinez or, as Antonio Gallo declares, by Bartholomew
Columbus,<a id="footnotetag482" name="footnotetag482"></a><a href="#footnote482" title="Go to footnote 482"><span class="small">[482]</span></a> or by some person in Portugal whose name we know not&mdash;it
would be difficult to decide. Neither can we fix the date when Columbus
first sought aid for his scheme from the Portuguese government. There
seems to be no good reason why he should not have been talking about it
before 1474; but the affair did not come to any kind of a climax until
after his return from Guinea, some time after <span class="sidenote">Martin Behaim's improved astrolabe.</span>
1482 and certainly not
later than 1484. It was on some accounts a favourable time. The war with
Castile was out of the way, and Martin Behaim had just invented an
improved astrolabe which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span> made it ever so much easier to find
and keep one's latitude at sea. It was in 1484 that Portuguese
discoveries took a fresh start after a ten years' lull, and Diego Cam,
with the learned Behaim and his bran-new astrolabe on board, was about
to sail a thousand miles farther south than white men had ever gone
before. About this time the scheme of Columbus was formally referred by
King John II. to the junto of learned cosmographers from whom the crown
had been wont to seek advice. The project was condemned as
"visionary,"<a id="footnotetag483" name="footnotetag483"></a><a href="#footnote483" title="Go to footnote 483"><span class="small">[483]</span></a> as indeed it was,&mdash;the outcome of vision that saw
farther than those men could see. But the king, who had some of his
uncle Prince Henry's love for bold enterprises, was more hospitably
inclined toward the ideas of <span class="sidenote">Negotiations of Columbus with John II. of Portugal.</span>
Columbus, and he summoned a council of the
most learned men in the kingdom to discuss the question.<a id="footnotetag484" name="footnotetag484"></a><a href="#footnote484" title="Go to footnote 484"><span class="small">[484]</span></a> In this
council the new scheme found some defenders, while others correctly
urged that Columbus must be wrong in supposing Asia to extend so far to
the east, and it must be a much longer voyage than he supposed to
Cipango and Cathay,<a id="footnotetag485" name="footnotetag485"></a><a href="#footnote485" title="Go to footnote 485"><span class="small">[485]</span></a> Others <span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>(p. 397)</span> argued that the late war had
impoverished the country, and that the enterprises on the African coast
were all that the treasury could afford. Here the demands of Columbus
were of themselves an obstacle to his success. He never at any time held
himself cheap,<a id="footnotetag486" name="footnotetag486"></a><a href="#footnote486" title="Go to footnote 486"><span class="small">[486]</span></a> and the rewards and honours for which he insisted on
stipulating were greater than the king of Portugal felt inclined to
bestow upon a plain Genoese mariner. It was felt that if the enterprise
should prove a failure, as very likely it would, the less heartily the
government should have committed itself to it beforehand, the less it
would expose itself to ridicule. King John was not in general disposed
toward unfair and dishonest dealings, but on this occasion, after much
parley, he was persuaded to sanction a proceeding <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span> quite
unworthy of him. Having obtained <span class="sidenote">A shabby trick.</span>
Columbus's sailing plans, he sent out a
ship secretly, to carry some goods to the Cape Verde islands, and then
to try the experiment of the westward voyage. If there should turn out
to be anything profitable in the scheme, this would be safer and more
frugal than to meet the exorbitant demands of this ambitious foreigner.
So it was done; but the pilots, having no grand idea to urge them
forward, lost heart before the stupendous expanse of waters that
confronted them, and beat an ignominious retreat to Lisbon; <span class="sidenote">Columbus leaves Portugal,</span>
whereupon
Columbus, having been informed of the trick,<a id="footnotetag487" name="footnotetag487"></a><a href="#footnote487" title="Go to footnote 487"><span class="small">[487]</span></a> departed in high
dudgeon, to lay his proposals before the crown of Castile. He seems to
have gone rather suddenly, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span> leaving his wife, who died shortly
after, and one or two children who must also have died, for he tells us
that he never saw them again. But his son Diego, aged perhaps four or
five years, he took with him as far as the town of Huelva, near the
little port of Palos in Andalusia, where he left him with one of his
wife's sisters, who had married a man of that town named Muliar.<a id="footnotetag488" name="footnotetag488"></a><a href="#footnote488" title="Go to footnote 488"><span class="small">[488]</span></a>
This arrival in Spain was probably late in the autumn of 1484, and
Columbus seems to have entered into the service of <span class="sidenote">and enters the service of the Spanish sovereigns, 1486.</span>
Ferdinand and
Isabella January 20, 1486. What he was doing in the interval of rather
more than a year is not known. There is a very doubtful tradition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>(p. 400)</span> that he tried to interest the republic of Genoa in his
enterprise,<a id="footnotetag489" name="footnotetag489"></a><a href="#footnote489" title="Go to footnote 489"><span class="small">[489]</span></a> and a still more doubtful rumour that he afterwards
made proposals to the Venetian senate.<a id="footnotetag490" name="footnotetag490"></a><a href="#footnote490" title="Go to footnote 490"><span class="small">[490]</span></a> If these things ever
happened, there was time enough for them in this year, and they can
hardly be assigned to any later period. In 1486 we find Columbus at
Cordova, where the sovereigns were holding court. He was unable to
effect anything until he had gained the ear of Isabella's finance
minister Alonso de Quintanilla, who had a mind hospitable to large
ideas. The two sovereigns had scarcely time to attend to such things,
for there was a third king in Spain, the Moor at Granada, whom there now
seemed a fair prospect of driving to Africa, and thus ending the
struggle that had lasted with few intermissions for nearly eight
centuries. The final war with Granada had been going on since the end of
1481, and considering how it weighed upon the minds of Ferdinand and
Isabella it is rather remarkable that cosmography got any hearing at
all. The affair was referred to the queen's confessor Fernando de
Talavera, whose first impression was that if what Columbus said was
true, it was very strange that other geographers should have failed to
know all about it long ago. Ideas of evolution had not yet begun to
exist in those days, and it was thought that what the ancients did not
know was not worth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span> knowing. Toward the end of 1486 the Spanish
sovereigns were at Salamanca, and <span class="sidenote">The junto at Salamanca.</span>
Talavera referred the question to a
junto of learned men, including professors of the famous
university.<a id="footnotetag491" name="footnotetag491"></a><a href="#footnote491" title="Go to footnote 491"><span class="small">[491]</span></a> There was no lack of taunt and ridicule, and a whole
arsenal of texts from Scripture and the Fathers were discharged at
Columbus, but it is noticeable that quite a number were inclined to
think that his scheme might be worth trying, and that some of his most
firmly convinced supporters were priests. No decision had been reached
when the sovereigns started on the Malaga campaign in the spring of
1487.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Malaga in August, 1487, Columbus visited the
court in that city. For a year or more after that time silken chains
seem to have bound him to Cordova. He had formed a connection with a
lady of noble family, <span class="sidenote">Birth of Ferdinand Columbus, Aug. 15, 1488.</span>
Beatriz Enriquez de Arana, who gave birth to his
son Ferdinand on the 15th of August, 1488.<a id="footnotetag492" name="footnotetag492"></a><a href="#footnote492" title="Go to footnote 492"><span class="small">[492]</span></a> Shortly after this
event, Columbus made a visit to Lisbon, in all probability for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>(p. 402)</span>
the purpose of meeting his brother <span class="sidenote">Bartholomew Columbus returns from the Cape of Good Hope, Dec,

Bartholomew, who had returned in the

rightly believed to be the extremity of Africa; and we can well
understand how Christopher, on seeing the success of Prince Henry's
method of reaching the Indies so nearly vindicated, must have become
more impatient than ever to prove the superiority of his own method. It
was probably not long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>(p. 404)</span> after Bartholomew's return that
Christopher determined to go and see him, for he applied to King John
II. for a kind of safe-conduct, which was duly granted March 20, 1488.
This document<a id="footnotetag494" name="footnotetag494"></a><a href="#footnote494" title="Go to footnote 494"><span class="small">[494]</span></a> guarantees Christopher against arrest or arraignment
or detention on any charge civil or criminal whatever, during his stay
in Portugal, and commands all magistrates in that kingdom to respect it.
From this it would seem probable that in the eagerness of his
geographical speculations he had neglected his business affairs and left
debts behind him in Portugal for which he was liable to be arrested.
<span class="sidenote">Christopher visits Bartholomew at Lisbon, cir. Sept., 1488;</span>
The
king's readiness to grant the desired privilege seems to indicate that
he may have cherished a hope of regaining the services of this
accomplished chart-maker and mariner. Christopher did not avail himself
of the privilege until late in the summer,<a id="footnotetag495" name="footnotetag495"></a><a href="#footnote495" title="Go to footnote 495"><span class="small">[495]</span></a> and it is only fair to
suppose that he waited for the birth of his child and some assurance of
its mother's safety. On meeting Bartholomew he evidently set him to work
forthwith in <span class="sidenote">and sends him to England.</span>
making overtures to the courts of England and France. It
was natural enough that Bartholomew should first set out for Bristol,
where old shipmates and acquaintances were sure to be found. It appears
that on the way he was captured by pirates, and thus some delay was
occasioned before he arrived in London <span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>(p. 405)</span> and showed the king a
map, probably similar to Toscanelli's and embellished with quaint Latin
verses. <span class="sidenote">Bartholomew, after mishaps, reaches England cir. Feb., 1490;</span>
An entry on this map informs us that it was made by Bartholomew
Columbus in London, February 10, 1488, which I think should be read 1489
or even 1490, so we may suppose it to have been about that time or
perhaps later that he approached the throne.<a id="footnotetag496" name="footnotetag496"></a><a href="#footnote496" title="Go to footnote 496"><span class="small">[496]</span></a> Henry VII. was
intelligent enough <span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span> to see the bearings of Bartholomew's
arguments, and at the same time, as a good man of business, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>(p. 407)</span> he
was likely to be cautious about investing money in remote or doubtful
enterprises. What arguments were used we do not know, but the spring of
1492 had arrived before any decisive answer had been given. <span class="sidenote">and goes thence to France before 1492.</span>
Meanwhile
Bartholomew had made his way to France, and found a powerful protector
in a certain Madame de Bourbon,<a id="footnotetag497" name="footnotetag497"></a><a href="#footnote497" title="Go to footnote 497"><span class="small">[497]</span></a> while he made maps for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>(p. 408)</span>
people at the court and waited to see if there were any chances of
getting help from Charles VIII.</p>

<p>As for Christopher Columbus, we find him back in Spain again, in May,
1489, attending court at Cordova. In the following autumn there was much
suffering in Spain from floods and famine,<a id="footnotetag498" name="footnotetag498"></a><a href="#footnote498" title="Go to footnote 498"><span class="small">[498]</span></a> and the sovereigns were
too busy with the Moorish war to give ear to Columbus. It was no time
for new undertakings, and the weary suitor began to think seriously of
going in person to the French court. First, however, he thought it worth
while to make an attempt to get private capital enlisted in his
enterprise, and in the Spain of that day such private capital meant a
largess from some wealthy grandee. Accordingly about Christmas of 1489,
after the Beza campaign in which Columbus is said to have fought with
distinguished valour,<a id="footnotetag499" name="footnotetag499"></a><a href="#footnote499" title="Go to footnote 499"><span class="small">[499]</span></a> he seems to have applied to the most powerful
nobleman in Spain, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, but without success. But
at the hands of <span class="sidenote">The Duke of Medina-Celi proposes to furnish the ships for
Columbus,</span>
Luis de la Cerda, Duke of Medina-Celi, he met with more
encouragement than he had as yet found in any quarter. That nobleman
entertained Columbus most hospitably at his castle at Puerto de Santa
Maria for nearly two years, until the autumn of 1491. He became
convinced that the scheme of Columbus was feasible, and decided to fit
up two or three caravels at his own expense, if necessary, but first he
thought it proper to ask the queen's consent, and to offer her another
chance to take part in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page409" name="page409"></a>(p. 409)</span> enterprise.<a id="footnotetag500" name="footnotetag500"></a><a href="#footnote500" title="Go to footnote 500"><span class="small">[500]</span></a> Isabella was
probably unwilling to have the duke come in for a large share of the
profits in case the venture should prove successful. <span class="sidenote">but Isabella withholds her consent.</span>
She refused the
royal license, saying that she had not quite made up her mind whether to
take up the affair or not, but if she should decide to do so she would
be glad to have the duke take part in it.<a id="footnotetag501" name="footnotetag501"></a><a href="#footnote501" title="Go to footnote 501"><span class="small">[501]</span></a> Meanwhile she referred
the question to Alonso de Quintanilla, comptroller of the treasury of
Castile. This was in the spring of 1491, when the whole country was in a
buzz of excitement with the preparations for the siege of Granada. The
baffled Columbus visited the sovereigns in camp, but could not get them
to attend to him, and early in the autumn, thoroughly disgusted and sick
at heart, <span class="sidenote">Columbus makes up his mind to get his family together and go
to France, Oct., 1491.</span>
he made up his mind to shake the dust of Castile from his feet
and see what could be done in France. In October or November he went to
Huelva, apparently to get his son Diego, who had been left there, in
charge of his aunt. It was probably his intention to take all the family
he had&mdash;Beatriz <span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>(p. 410)</span> and her infant son Ferdinand, of whom he was
extremely fond, as well as Diego&mdash;and find a new home in either France
or England, besides ascertaining what had become of his brother
Bartholomew, from whom he had not heard a word since the latter left
Portugal for England.<a id="footnotetag502" name="footnotetag502"></a><a href="#footnote502" title="Go to footnote 502"><span class="small">[502]</span></a></p>

<p>But now at length events took a favourable turn. Fate had grown tired of
fighting against such indomitable perseverance. For some years now the
stately figure of Columbus had been a familiar sight in the streets of
Seville and Cordova, and as he passed along, with his white hair
streaming in the breeze, and countenance aglow with intensity of purpose
or haggard with disappointment at some fresh rebuff, the ragged urchins
of the pavement tapped their foreheads and smiled with mingled wonder
and amusement at this madman. Seventeen years had elapsed since the
letter from Toscanelli to Martinez, and all that was mortal of the
Florentine astronomer had long since been laid in the grave. For
Columbus himself old age was not far away, yet he seemed no nearer the
fulfilment of his grand purpose than when he had first set it forth to
the king of Portugal. We can well imagine that when he started from
Huelva, with his little son Diego, now some eleven or twelve years old,
again to begin renewing his suit in a strange country, his thoughts must
have been sombre enough. For some reason or other&mdash;tradition says to ask
for some bread and water for his boy&mdash;he stopped at the Franciscan
monastery <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>(p. 411)</span> of La Rábida, about half a league from Palos. The
prior, <span class="sidenote">He stops at La Rábida, and meets the prior Juan Perez.</span>
Juan Perez, who had never seen Columbus before, became greatly
interested in him and listened with earnest attention to his story. This
worthy monk, who before 1478 had been Isabella's father-confessor, had a
mind hospitable to new ideas. He sent for Garcia Fernandez, a physician
of Palos, who was somewhat versed in cosmography, and for Martin Alonso
Pinzon, a well-to-do ship-owner and trained mariner of that town, and in
the quiet of the monastery a conference was held in which Columbus
carried conviction to the minds of these new friends. Pinzon declared
himself ready to embark in the enterprise in person. <span class="sidenote">Perez writes to the queen,</span>
The venerable prior
forthwith sent a letter to the queen, and received a very prompt reply
summoning him to attend her in the camp before Granada. The result of
the interview was that within a few days Perez returned to the convent
with a purse of 20,000 maravedis (equivalent to about 1,180 dollars of
the present day), out of which Columbus bought a new suit of clothes and
a mule; <span class="sidenote">and Columbus is summoned back to court.</span>
and about the first of December he set out for the camp in
company with Juan Perez, leaving the boy Diego in charge of the priest
Martin Sanchez and a certain Rodriguez Cabejudo, upon whose sworn
testimony, together with that of the physician Garcia Fernandez, some
years afterward, several of these facts are related.<a id="footnotetag503" name="footnotetag503"></a><a href="#footnote503" title="Go to footnote 503"><span class="small">[503]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>(p. 412)</span>

<p>At once upon the arrival of Columbus in the camp before Granada, his
case was argued then <span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>(p. 413)</span> and there before an assembly of learned
men and was received more hospitably than formerly, at Salamanca.
<span class="sidenote">The junto before Granada, Dec, 1491.</span>
Several eminent prelates had come to think favourably of his project or
to deem it at least worth a trial. Among these were the royal
confessors, Deza and Talavera, the latter having changed his mind, and
especially Mendoza, archbishop of Toledo, who now threw his vast
influence decisively in favour of Columbus.<a id="footnotetag504" name="footnotetag504"></a><a href="#footnote504" title="Go to footnote 504"><span class="small">[504]</span></a> The treasurers of the
two kingdoms, moreover, Quintanilla for Castile and Luis de Santangel
for Aragon, were among his most enthusiastic supporters; and the result
of the conference was the queen's promise to take up the matter in
earnest as soon as the Moor should have surrendered Granada.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>(p. 414)</span>

<p>Columbus had not long to wait for that great event, which came on the 2d
of January, 1492, <span class="sidenote">Surrender of Granada, Jan. 2, 1492.</span>
and was hailed with rejoicings throughout Europe as in
some sort a compensation for the loss of Constantinople. It must have
been with a manifold sense of triumph that Columbus saw the banner of
Spain unfurled to the breeze from the highest tower of the Alhambra. But
at this critical moment in his fortunes the same obstacle was
encountered that long before had broken off his negotiations with the
king of Portugal. With pride and self-confidence not an inch abated by
all these years of trial, he demanded such honours and substantial
rewards as seemed extravagant to the queen, and Talavera advised her not
to grant them. Columbus insisted upon being appointed admiral of the
ocean and viceroy of such heathen countries as he might discover,
<span class="sidenote">Columbus negotiates with the queen.</span>
besides having for his own use and behoof one eighth part of such
revenues and profits as might accrue from the expedition. In principle
this sort of remuneration did not differ from that which the crown of
Portugal had been wont to award to its eminent discoverers;<a id="footnotetag505" name="footnotetag505"></a><a href="#footnote505" title="Go to footnote 505"><span class="small">[505]</span></a> but in
amount it was liable to prove <span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>(p. 415)</span> indefinitely great, enough
perhaps to raise to princely power and rank this foreign adventurer.
Could he not be satisfied with something less? But Columbus was as
inexorable as the Sibyl with her books, and would hear of no abatement
in his price. For this "great constancy and loftiness of soul,"<a id="footnotetag506" name="footnotetag506"></a><a href="#footnote506" title="Go to footnote 506"><span class="small">[506]</span></a> Las
Casas warmly commends his friend Columbus. A querulous critic might call
it unreasonable obstinacy. But in truth the good man seems to have
entertained another grand scheme of his own, to which he wished to make
his maritime venture contribute. It was natural that his feelings toward
Turks should have been no more amiable than those of Hannibal toward the
Romans. It was the Turks who had ruined the commerce of his native
Genoa, in his youth he had more than once crossed swords with their
corsairs, and now he looked forward to the time when he might play the
part of a second Godfrey de Bouillon and deliver Jerusalem from the
miscreant followers of Mahound.<a id="footnotetag507" name="footnotetag507"></a><a href="#footnote507" title="Go to footnote 507"><span class="small">[507]</span></a> Vast resources would be needed for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416"></a>(p. 416)</span> such work, and from Cipango with its gold-roofed temples, and
the nameless and numberless isles of spices that crowded the Cathayan
seas, he hoped to obtain them. Long brooding over his cherished
projects, in which chimeras were thus mixed with anticipations of
scientific truth, had imparted to his character a tinge of religious
fanaticism. He had come to regard himself as a man with a mission to
fulfil, <span class="sidenote">His terms are considered exorbitant.</span>
as God's chosen instrument for enlarging the bounds of
Christendom and achieving triumphs of untold magnificence for its
banners. In this mood he was apt to address kings with an air of
equality that ill comported with his humble origin and slender means;
and on the present occasion, if Talavera felt his old doubts and
suspicions reviving, and was more than half inclined to set Columbus
down as a mere vendor of crotchets, one can hardly wonder.</p>

<p>The negotiations were broken off, and the indomitable enthusiast once
more prepared to go to France. He had actually started on his mule one
fine winter day, when <span class="sidenote">Interposition of Luis de Santangel.</span>
Luis de Santangel rushed into the queen's room and
spoke to her with all the passionate and somewhat reproachful energy of
one who felt that a golden opportunity was slipping away forever. His
arguments were warmly seconded by Quintanilla, who had followed him into
the room, as well as by the queen's bosom friend Beatriz de Bobadilla,
Marchioness of Moya, who happened to be sitting on the sofa and was a
devoted admirer of Columbus. An impulse seized Isabella. A courier was
sent on a fleet horse, and overtook Columbus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page417" name="page417"></a>(p. 417)</span> as he was jogging
quietly over the bridge of Pinos, about six miles out from Granada. The
matter was reconsidered and an arrangement was soon made. It was
agreed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That Columbus should have, for himself, during his life, and for his
heirs and successors forever, the <span class="sidenote">Agreement between Columbus and the sovereigns.</span>
office of admiral in all the islands
and continents which he might discover or acquire in the ocean, with
similar honours and prerogatives to those enjoyed by the high admiral of
Castile in his district.</p>

<p>"2. That he should be viceroy and governor-general over all the said
lands and continents; with the privilege of nominating three candidates
for the government of each island or province, one of whom should be
selected by the sovereigns.</p>

<p>"3. That he should be entitled to reserve for himself one tenth of all
pearls, precious stones, gold, silver, spices, and all other articles
and merchandises, in whatever manner found, bought, bartered, or gained
within his admiralty, the costs being first deducted.</p>

<p>"4. That he, or his lieutenant, should be the sole judge in all causes
and disputes arising out of traffic between those countries and Spain,
provided the high admiral of Castile had similar jurisdiction in his
district.</p>

<p>"5. That he might then, and at all after times, contribute an eighth
part of the expense in fitting out vessels to sail on this enterprise,
and receive an eighth part of the profits."<a id="footnotetag508" name="footnotetag508"></a><a href="#footnote508" title="Go to footnote 508"><span class="small">[508]</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>(p. 418)</span> Columbus was not long in finding friends to advance or promise
on his account an eighth part of the sum immediately required. A
considerable amount was assessed upon the town of Palos in punishment
for certain misdeeds or delinquencies on the part of its people or some
of them. Castile assumed the rest of the burden, though Santangel may
have advanced a million maravedis out of the treasury of Aragon, or out
of the funds of the <i>Hermandad</i>,<a id="footnotetag509" name="footnotetag509"></a><a href="#footnote509" title="Go to footnote 509"><span class="small">[509]</span></a> or perhaps more likely on his own
account.<a id="footnotetag510" name="footnotetag510"></a><a href="#footnote510" title="Go to footnote 510"><span class="small">[510]</span></a> In any case it was a loan to the treasury of Castile
simply. It was always distinctly understood <span class="pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>(p. 419)</span> that Ferdinand as
king of Aragon had no share in the enterprise, and that the Spanish
Indies were an appurtenance to the crown of Castile. The agreement was
signed April 17, 1492, and with tears of joy Columbus vowed to devote
every maravedi that should come to him to the rescue of the Holy
Sepulchre.</p>

<p>When he reached Palos in May, with royal orders for ships and men, there
had like to have been a riot. <span class="sidenote">Dismay at Palos.</span>
Terrible dismay was felt at the prospect
of launching out for such a voyage <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>(p. 420)</span> upon the Sea of Darkness.
Groans and curses greeted the announcement of the forced contribution.
But Martin Pinzon and his brothers were active in supporting the crown
officials, and the work went on. To induce men to enlist, debts were
forgiven and civil actions suspended. Criminals were released from jail
on condition of serving. Three caravels were impressed into the service
of the crown for a time unlimited; and <span class="sidenote">The three famous caravels; the Santa Maria.</span>
the rent and maintenance of two
of these vessels for two months was to be paid by the town. The largest
caravel, called the Santa Maria or Capitana, belonged to Juan de La
Cosa, a Biscayan mariner whose name was soon to become famous.<a id="footnotetag511" name="footnotetag511"></a><a href="#footnote511" title="Go to footnote 511"><span class="small">[511]</span></a> He
now commanded her, with another consummate sailor, Sancho Ruiz, for his
pilot. This single-decked craft, about ninety feet in length by twenty
feet breadth of beam, was the Admiral's flag-ship. The second caravel,
called the <span class="sidenote">The Pinta.</span>
Pinta, a much swifter vessel, was commanded by Martin Pinzon.
She belonged to two citizens of Palos, Gomez Rascon and Cristobal
Quintero, who were now in her crew, sulky and ready for mischief. The
third and smallest caravel, the <span class="sidenote">The Niña.</span>
Niña ("Baby"), had for her commander
Vicente Yañez Pinzon, the youngest of the brothers, now about thirty
years of age. Neither the Pinta nor the Niña were decked amidships. On
board the three caravels were just ninety persons.<a id="footnotetag512" name="footnotetag512"></a><a href="#footnote512" title="Go to footnote 512"><span class="small">[512]</span></a> And so they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>(p. 421)</span> set sail from Palos on Friday, August 3, 1492, half an hour
before sunrise, and by sunset had run due south five and forty
geographical miles, when they shifted their course a couple of points to
starboard and stood for the Canaries.</p>

<p>No thought of Vinland is betrayed in these proceedings. Columbus was
aiming at the northern end of Cipango (Japan). Upon Toscanelli's map,
which he carried with him, the great island of Cipango extends from 5°
to about 28° north latitude. He evidently aimed at the northern end of
Cipango as being directly on the route to Zaiton (Chang-chow) and other
Chinese cities mentioned by Marco Polo. Accordingly he began by running
down to the Canaries, in order that he might sail thence due west on the
<span class="sidenote">They go to the Canaries and are delayed there.</span>
28th parallel without shifting his course by a single point until he
should see the coast of Japan looming up before him.<a id="footnotetag513" name="footnotetag513"></a><a href="#footnote513" title="Go to footnote 513"><span class="small">[513]</span></a> On this
preliminary run signs of mischief began already to show themselves. The
Pinta's rudder was broken and unshipped, and Columbus suspected her two
angry and chafing owners of having done it on purpose, in order that
they and their vessel might be left behind. The Canaries at this
juncture merited the name of Fortunate Islands; fortunately they, alone
among African islands, were Spanish, so that Columbus could stop there
and make repairs. While this was going on the sailors <span class="pagenum"><a id="page424" name="page424"></a>(p. 424)</span> were
scared out of their wits by an eruption of Teneriffe, which they deemed
an omen of evil, and it was also reported that some Portuguese caravels
were hovering in those waters, with intent to capture Columbus and carry
him off to Lisbon.</p>

</div>

<p>At length, on the 6th of September, they set sail from <span class="sidenote">Columbus starts for Japan, Sept. 6, 1492.</span>
Gomera, but were
becalmed and had made only thirty miles by the night of the 8th. The
breeze then freshened, and when next day the shores of Ferro, the last
of the Canaries, sank from sight on the eastern horizon, many of the
sailors loudly lamented their unseemly fate, and cried and sobbed like
children. Columbus well understood the difficulty of dealing with these
men. He provided against one chief source of discontent by keeping two
different reckonings, a true one for himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>(p. 425)</span> and a false one
for his officers and crews. He was shrewd enough not to overdo it and
awaken distrust. Thus after a twenty-four hours' run of 180 miles on
September 10, he reported it as 144 miles; next day the run was 120
miles and he announced it as 108, and so on. But for this prudent if
somewhat questionable device, it is not unlikely that the first week of
October would have witnessed a mutiny in which Columbus would have been
either thrown overboard or forced to turn back.</p>

<p>The weather was delicious, and but for the bug-a-boos that worried those
poor sailors it would have been a most pleasant voyage. Chief among the
imaginary terrors were three which deserve especial mention. At
nightfall on September 13 the ships had crossed the magnetic line of no
variation, and Columbus was astonished to see that the compass-needle,
instead of <span class="sidenote">Deflection of the needle.</span>
pointing a little to the right of the pole-star, began to
sway toward the left, and next day this deviation increased. It was
impossible to hide such a fact from the sharp eyes of the pilots, and
all were seized with alarm at the suspicion that this witch instrument
was beginning to play them some foul trick in punishment of their
temerity; but Columbus was ready with an ingenious astronomical
explanation, and their faith in the profundity of his knowledge
prevailed over their terrors.</p>

<p>The second alarm came on September 16, when they struck into vast
meadows of floating seaweeds and grasses, abounding in tunny fish and
crabs. They had now come more than 800 miles from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426"></a>(p. 426)</span> Ferro and
were entering the wonderful <span class="sidenote">The Sargasso Sea.</span>
Sargasso Sea, that region of the Atlantic
six times as large as France, where vast tangles of vegetation grow upon
the surface of water that is more than 2,000 fathoms deep, and furnish
sustenance for an untold wealth of fishy life.<a id="footnotetag515" name="footnotetag515"></a><a href="#footnote515" title="Go to footnote 515"><span class="small">[515]</span></a> To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427"></a>(p. 427)</span> the eye
of the mariner the Sargasso Sea presents somewhat the appearance of an
endless green prairie, but modern ships plough through it with ease and
so did the caravels of Columbus at first. After two or three days,
however, the wind being light, their progress was somewhat impeded. It
was not strange that the crews were frightened at such a sight. It
seemed uncanny and weird, and revived ancient fancies about mysterious
impassable seas and overbold mariners whose ships had been stuck fast in
them. The more practical spirits were afraid of running aground upon
submerged shoals, but all were somewhat reassured on this point when it
was found that their longest plummet-lines failed to find bottom.</p>

<p>On September 22 the journal reports "no more grass." They were in clear
water again, and more than 1,400 geographical miles from the Canaries.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428"></a>(p. 428)</span> A third source of alarm had already begun to disturb the
sailors. They were discovering much more than they had bargained for.
<span class="sidenote">The trade wind.</span>
They were in the belt of the trade winds, and as the gentle but
unfailing breeze wafted them steadily westward, doubts began to arise as
to whether it would ever be possible to return. Fortunately soon after
this question began to be discussed, the wind, jealous of its character
for capriciousness even there, veered into the southwest.</p>

<p>By September 25 the Admiral's chief difficulty had come to be the
impatience of his crews at not finding land. <span class="sidenote">Impatience of the crews.</span>
On that day there was a
mirage, or some such illusion, which Columbus and all hands supposed to
be a coast in front of them, and hymns of praise were sung, but at dawn
next day they were cruelly undeceived. Flights of strange birds and
other signs of land kept raising hopes which were presently dashed
again, and the men passed through alternately hot and cold fits of
exultation and dejection. Such mockery seemed to show that they were
entering a realm of enchantment. Somebody, perhaps one of the released
jail-birds, hinted that if a stealthy thrust should happen some night to
push the Admiral overboard, it could be plausibly said that he had
slipped and fallen while star-gazing. His situation grew daily more
perilous, and the fact that he was an Italian commanding Spaniards did
not help him. Perhaps what saved him was their vague belief in his
superior knowledge; they may have felt that they should need him in
going back.</p>

<p>By October 4 there were ominous symptoms of mutiny, and the anxiety of
Columbus was evinced in the extent of his bold understatement of that
day's run,&mdash;138 miles instead of the true figure 189. For some days his
pilots had been begging him to change his course; perhaps they had
passed between islands. Anything for a change! On the 7th at sunrise,
they had come <span class="sidenote">Change of course from W. to W. S. W.</span>
2,724 geographical miles from the Canaries, which was
farther than the Admiral's estimate of the distance to Cipango; but
according to his false statement of the runs, it appeared that they had
come scarcely 2,200 miles. This leads one to suspect that in stating the
length of the voyage, as he had so often done, at 700 leagues, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page430" name="page430"></a>(p. 430)</span>
he may have purposely made it out somewhat shorter than he really
believed it to be. But now after coming more than 2,500 miles he began
to fear that he might be sailing past Cipango on the north, and so he
shifted his course two points to larboard, or west-southwest. If a
secret knowledge of Vinland had been his guiding-star he surely would
not have turned his helm that way; but a glance at the Toscanelli map
shows what was in his mind. Numerous flights of small birds confirmed
his belief that land at the southwest was not far off. The change of
direction was probably fortunate. If he had persisted in keeping on the
parallel, 720 miles would have brought him to the coast of Florida, a
little south of Cape Malabar. After the change he had but 505 miles of
water before him, and the temper of the sailors was growing more
dangerous with every mile,<a id="footnotetag516" name="footnotetag516"></a><a href="#footnote516" title="Go to footnote 516"><span class="small">[516]</span></a>&mdash;until October 11, when the signs of
land became unmistakable, and the wildest excitement prevailed. A reward
of 10,000 maravedis had been promised to the person who should first
discover land, and ninety pair of eyes were strained that night with
looking. About ten o'clock the Admiral, standing on the tower-like poop
of his vessel, saw a distant light moving as if somebody were running
along <span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431"></a>(p. 431)</span> the shore with a torch. This interpretation was doubted,
but a few hours later a sailor on the Pinta saw land distinctly, and
soon it was visible to all, <span class="sidenote">Land ahead! Oct. 12 (N. S. 21), 1492.</span>
a long low coast about five miles distant.
This was at two in the morning of Friday, October 12,<a id="footnotetag517" name="footnotetag517"></a><a href="#footnote517" title="Go to footnote 517"><span class="small">[517]</span></a>&mdash;just ten
weeks since they had sailed from Palos, just thirty-three days since
they had lost sight of the coast of Ferro. The sails were now taken in,
and the ships lay to, awaiting the dawn.</p>

<hr>

<p>At daybreak the boats were lowered and Columbus, with a large part of
his company, went ashore. Upon every side were trees of unknown kinds,
and the landscape seemed exceedingly beautiful. <span class="sidenote">The crews go ashore.</span>
Confident that they must
have attained the object for which they had set sail, the crews were
wild with exultation. Their heads were dazed with fancies of princely
fortunes close at hand. The officers embraced Columbus or kissed his
hands, while the sailors threw themselves at his feet, craving pardon
and favour.</p>

<p>These proceedings were watched with unutterable amazement and awe by a
multitude of men, women, and <span class="sidenote">The astonished natives.</span>
children of cinnamon hue, different from
any kind of people the Spaniards had ever seen. All were stark naked and
most of them were more or less greased and painted. They thought that
the ships were sea-monsters and the white men supernatural creatures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page432" name="page432"></a>(p. 432)</span> descended from the sky.<a id="footnotetag518" name="footnotetag518"></a><a href="#footnote518" title="Go to footnote 518"><span class="small">[518]</span></a> At first they fled in terror as
these formidable beings came ashore, but presently, as they found
themselves unmolested, curiosity began to overcome fear, and they slowly
approached the Spaniards, stopping at every few paces to prostrate
themselves in adoration. After a time, as the Spaniards received them
with encouraging nods and smiles, they waxed bold enough to come close
to the visitors and pass their hands over them, doubtless to make sure
that all this marvel was a reality and not a mere vision. Experiences in
Africa had revealed the eagerness of barbarians to trade off their
possessions for trinkets, and now the Spaniards began exchanging glass
beads and hawks' bells for cotton yarn, tame parrots, and small gold
ornaments. Some sort of conversation in dumb show went on, and Columbus
naturally interpreted everything in such wise as to fit his theories.
Whether the natives understood him or not when he asked them where they
got their gold, at any rate they pointed to the south, and thus
confirmed Columbus in his suspicion that he had come to some island a
little to the north of the opulent Cipango. <span class="sidenote">Guanahani: where was it?</span>
He soon found that it was a
small island, and he understood the name of it to be Guanahani. He took
formal possession of it for Castile, just as the discoverers of the Cape
Verde islands and the Guinea coasts had taken possession of those places
for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page433" name="page433"></a>(p. 433)</span> Portugal; and he gave it a Christian name, San Salvador.
That name has since the seventeenth century been given to Cat island,
but perhaps in pursuance of a false theory of map-makers; it is not
proved that Cat island is the Guanahani of Columbus. All that can
positively be asserted of Guanahani is that it was one of the Bahamas:
there has been endless discussion as to which one, and the question is
not easy to settle. Perhaps the theory of Captain Gustavus Fox, of the
United States navy, is on the whole best supported. Captain Fox
maintains that the true Guanahani was the little island now known as
Samana or Atwood's Cay.<a id="footnotetag519" name="footnotetag519"></a><a href="#footnote519" title="Go to footnote 519"><span class="small">[519]</span></a> The problem well illustrates the difficulty
in identifying any route from even a good description of landmarks,
without the help of persistent proper names, especially after the lapse
of time has somewhat altered the landmarks. From this point of view it
is a very interesting problem and has its lessons for us; otherwise it
is of no importance.</p>

<p>A cruise of ten days among the Bahamas, with visits to four of the
islands, satisfied Columbus that he was in the ocean just east of
Cathay, for <span class="sidenote">Groping for Cipango and the route to Quinsay.</span>
Marco Polo had described it as studded with thousands of
spice-bearing islands, and the Catalan map shows that some of these were
supposed to be inhabited by naked savages. To be sure, he could not find
any spices or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page434" name="page434"></a>(p. 434)</span> valuable drugs, but the air was full of
fragrance and the trees and herbs were strange in aspect and might mean
anything; so for a while he was ready to take the spices on trust. Upon
inquiries about gold the natives always pointed to the south, apparently
meaning Cipango; and in that direction Columbus steered on the 25th of
October, intending to stay in that wealthy island long enough to obtain
all needful information concerning its arts and commerce. Thence a sail
of less than ten days would bring him to the Chinese coast, along which
he might comfortably cruise northwesterly as far as Quinsay and deliver
to the Great Khan a friendly letter with which Ferdinand and Isabella
had provided him. Alas, poor Columbus&mdash;unconscious prince of
discoverers&mdash;groping here in Cuban waters for the way to a city on the
other side of the globe and to a sovereign whose race had more than a
century since been driven from the throne and expelled from the very
soil of Cathay! Could anything be more pathetic, or better illustrate
the profound irony with which our universe seems to be governed?</p>

<p>On reaching Cuba the Admiral was charmed with the marvellous beauty of
the landscape,&mdash;a point in which he seems to have been unusually
sensitive. <span class="sidenote">Columbus reaches Cuba, and sends envoys to find a certain
Asiatic prince.</span>
He found pearl oysters along the shore, and although no
splendid cities as yet appeared, he did not doubt that he had reached
Cipango. But his attempts at talking with the amazed natives only served
to darken counsel. He understood them to say that Cuba was part of the
Asiatic continent, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page435" name="page435"></a>(p. 435)</span> and that there was a king in the
neighbourhood who was at war with the Great Khan! So he sent two
messengers to seek this refractory potentate,&mdash;one of them a converted
Jew acquainted with Arabic, a language sometimes heard far eastward in
Asia, as Columbus must have known. These envoys found pleasant villages,
with large houses, surrounded with fields of such unknown vegetables as
maize, potatoes, and tobacco; they saw men and women smoking
cigars,<a id="footnotetag520" name="footnotetag520"></a><a href="#footnote520" title="Go to footnote 520"><span class="small">[520]</span></a> and little dreamed that in that fragrant and soothing herb
there was a richer source of revenue than the spices of the East. They
passed acres of growing cotton and saw in the houses piles of yarn
waiting to be woven into rude cloth or twisted into nets for hammocks.
But they found neither cities nor kings, neither gold nor spices, and
after a tedious quest returned, somewhat disappointed, to the coast.</p>

<p>Columbus seems now to have become perplexed, and to have vacillated
somewhat in his purposes. If this was the continent of <span class="sidenote">Columbus turns eastward; Pinzon deserts him.</span>
Asia it was
nearer than he had supposed, and how far mistaken he had been in his
calculations no one could tell. But where was Cipango? He gathered from
the natives that there was a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page436" name="page436"></a>(p. 436)</span> great island to the southeast,
abounding in gold, and so he turned his prows in that direction. On the
20th of November he was deserted by Martin Pinzon, whose ship could
always outsail the others. It seems to have been Pinzon's design to get
home in advance with such a story as would enable him to claim for
himself an undue share of credit for the discovery of the Indies. This
was the earliest instance of a kind of treachery such as too often
marred the story of Spanish exploration and conquest in the New World.</p>


<p>For a fortnight after Pinzon's desertion Columbus crept slowly eastward
along the coast of Cuba, now and then landing to examine the country and
its products; and it seemed to him that besides pearls and mastic and
aloes he found in the rivers indications of gold. When he reached the
cape at the end of the island he named it Alpha and Omega, as being the
extremity of Asia,&mdash;Omega from the Portuguese point of view, Alpha from
his own. On the 6th of December he landed upon the northwestern coast of
the island of Hayti, which he called <span class="sidenote">Columbus arrives at Hayti and thinks it must be Japan.</span>
Española, Hispaniola, or "Spanish
land."<a id="footnotetag521" name="footnotetag521"></a><a href="#footnote521" title="Go to footnote 521"><span class="small">[521]</span></a> Here, as the natives seemed to tell him of a region to the
southward and quite inland which abounded in gold, and which they called
Cibao, the Admiral at once caught upon the apparent similarity of sounds
and fancied that Cibao must be Cipango, and that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page437" name="page437"></a>(p. 437)</span> at length he
had arrived upon that island of marvels. It was much nearer the Asiatic
mainland (i. e. Cuba) than he had supposed, but then, it was beginning
to appear that in any case somebody's geography must be wrong. Columbus
was enchanted with the scenery. "The land is elevated," he says, "with
many mountains and peaks ... most beautiful, of a thousand varied forms,
accessible, and full of trees of endless varieties, so tall that they
seem to touch the sky; and I have been told that they never lose their
foliage. The nightingale [i. e. some kind of thrush] and other small
birds of a thousand kinds were singing in the month of November
[December] when I was there."<a id="footnotetag522" name="footnotetag522"></a><a href="#footnote522" title="Go to footnote 522"><span class="small">[522]</span></a> Before he had done much toward
exploring this paradise, a sudden and grave mishap quite altered his
plans. <span class="sidenote">Wreck of the Santa Maria, Dec. 25, 1492.</span>
On Christmas morning, between midnight and dawn, owing to
careless disobedience of orders on the part of the helmsman, the
flag-ship struck upon a sand-bank near the present site of Port au Paix.
All attempts to get her afloat were unavailing, and the waves soon beat
her to pieces.</p>

<p>This catastrophe brought home, with startling force, to the mind of
Columbus, the fact that the news of his discovery of land was not yet
known in Europe. As for the Pinta and her insubordinate commander, none
could say <span class="sidenote">Columbus decides to go back to Spain.</span>
whether they would ever be seen again or whether their speedy
arrival in Spain might not portend more harm than good to Columbus.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page438" name="page438"></a>(p. 438)</span> His armament was now reduced to the little undecked Niña
alone, such a craft as we should deem about fit for a summer excursion
on Long Island Sound. What if his party should all perish, or be
stranded helpless on these strange coasts, before any news of their
success should reach the ears of friends in Europe! Then the name of
Columbus would serve as a by-word for foolhardiness, and his mysterious
fate would simply deter other expeditions from following in the same
course. Obviously the first necessity of the situation was to return to
Spain immediately and report what had already been done. Then it would
be easy enough to get ships and men for a second voyage.</p>

<p>This decision led to the founding of an embryo colony upon Hispaniola.
There was not room enough for all the party to go in the Nina, and quite
a number begged to be left behind, because they found life upon the
island lazy and the natives, especially the women, seemed well-disposed
toward them. So a blockhouse was built out of the <span class="sidenote">Building of the blockhouse, La Navidad.</span>
wrecked ship's timbers
and armed with her guns, and in commemoration of that eventful Christmas
it was called Fort Nativity (<i>La Navidad</i>). Here forty men were left
behind, with provisions enough for a whole year, and on January 4, 1493,
the rest of the party went on board the Niña and set sail for Spain. Two
days later in following the northern coast of Hispaniola they
encountered the Pinta, whose <span class="sidenote">Meeting with Pinzon.</span>
commander had been delayed by trading with
the natives and by finding some gold. Pinzon tried to explain his sudden
disappearance by alleging that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page439" name="page439"></a>(p. 439)</span> stress of weather had parted
him from his comrades, but his excuses were felt to be lame and
improbable. However it may have been with his excuses, there was no
doubt as to the lameness of his foremast; it had been too badly sprung
to carry much sail, so that the Pinta could not again run away from her
consort.</p>

<p>On this return voyage the Admiral, finding the trade winds dead against
him, took a northeasterly course until he had passed the thirty-seventh
parallel and then headed straight toward Spain. On the <span class="sidenote">Terrible storm in mid-ocean, Feb., 1493.</span>
12th of February
a storm was brewing, and during the next four days it raged with such
terrific violence that it is a wonder how those two frail caravels ever
came out of it. They were separated this time not to meet again upon the
sea. Expecting in all likelihood to be engulfed in the waves with his
tiny craft, Columbus sealed and directed to Ferdinand and Isabella two
brief reports of his discovery, written upon parchment. Each of these he
wrapped in a cloth and inclosed in the middle of a large cake of wax,
which was then securely shut up in a barrel. One of the barrels was
flung into the sea, the other remained standing on the little
quarter-deck to await the fate of the caravel. The anxiety was not
lessened by the sight of land on the 15th, for it was impossible to
approach it so as to go ashore, and there was much danger of being
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>At length on the 18th, the storm having abated, the ship's boat went
ashore and found that it was the island of St. Mary, one of the Azores.
It is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page440" name="page440"></a>(p. 440)</span> worthy of note that such skilful sailors as the Nina's
captain, Vicente Yañez Pinzon, and the pilot Ruiz were so confused in
their <span class="sidenote">Cold reception at the Azores.</span>
reckoning as to suppose themselves near the Madeiras, whereas
Columbus had correctly maintained that they were approaching the
Azores,&mdash;a good instance of his consummate judgment in nautical
questions.<a id="footnotetag523" name="footnotetag523"></a><a href="#footnote523" title="Go to footnote 523"><span class="small">[523]</span></a> From the Portuguese governor of the island this Spanish
company met with a very ungracious reception. A party of sailors whom
Columbus sent ashore to a small chapel of the Virgin, to give thanks for
their deliverance from shipwreck, were seized and held as prisoners for
five days. It afterwards appeared that this was done in pursuance of
general instructions from the king of Portugal to the governors of his
various islands. If Columbus had gone ashore he would probably have been
arrested himself. As it was, he took such a high tone and threatened to
such good purpose that the governor of St. Mary was fain to give up his
prisoners for fear of bringing on another war between Portugal and
Castile.</p>

<p>Having at length got away from this unfriendly island, as the Niña was
making her way toward Cape St. Vincent and within 400 miles of it, she
was seized by another fierce tempest and driven upon the coast of
Portugal, <span class="sidenote">Columbus is driven ashore in Portugal, where the king is
advised to have him assassinated;</span>
where Columbus and his crew were glad of a chance to run into
the river Tagus for shelter. The news of his voyage and his discoveries
aroused intense excitement in Lisbon. Astonishment was mingled with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page441" name="page441"></a>(p. 441)</span> chagrin at the thought that the opportunity for all this glory
and profit had first been offered to Portugal and foolishly lost. The
king even now tried to persuade himself that Columbus had somehow or
other been trespassing upon the vast and vague undiscovered dominions
granted to the Crown of Portugal by Pope Eugenius IV. Some of the king's
counsellors are said to have urged him to have Columbus assassinated; it
would be easy enough to provoke such a high-spirited man into a quarrel
and then run him through the body.<a id="footnotetag524" name="footnotetag524"></a><a href="#footnote524" title="Go to footnote 524"><span class="small">[524]</span></a> To clearer heads, however, the
imprudence of such a course was manifest. It was already impossible to
keep the news of the discovery from reaching <span class="sidenote">but to offend Spain so grossly would be dangerous.</span>
Spain, and Portugal could
not afford to go to war with her stronger neighbour. In fact even had
John II. been base enough to resort to assassination, which seems quite
incompatible with the general character of Lope de Vega's "perfect
prince," Columbus was now too important a personage to be safely
interfered with. So he was invited to court and made much of. On the
13th of March he set sail again and arrived in the harbour of Palos at
noon of the 15th. His little caravel was promptly recognized by the
people, and as her story flew from mouth to mouth all the business of
the town was at an end for that day.<a id="footnotetag525" name="footnotetag525"></a><a href="#footnote525" title="Go to footnote 525"><span class="small">[525]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page442" name="page442"></a>(p. 442)</span>
<p>Towards evening, while the bells were ringing and the streets brilliant
with torches, another vessel entered the harbour and dropped anchor. She
was none other than the <span class="sidenote">Columbus and Pinzon at Palos; death of Pinzon.</span>
Pinta! The storm had driven her to Bayonne,
whence Martin Pinzon instantly despatched a message to Ferdinand and
Isabella, making great claims for himself and asking permission to wait
upon them with a full account of the discovery. As soon as practicable
he made his way to Palos, but when on arriving he saw the Niña already
anchored in the harbour his guilty heart failed him. He took advantage
of the general hub-bub to slink ashore as quickly and quietly as
possible, and did not dare to show himself until after the Admiral had
left for Seville. The news from Columbus reached the sovereigns before
they had time to reply to the message of Pinzon; so when their answer
came to him it was cold and stern and forbade him to appear in their
presence. Pinzon was worn out with the hardships of the homeward voyage,
and this crushing reproof was more than he could bear. His sudden death,
a few days afterward, was generally attributed to chagrin.<a id="footnotetag526" name="footnotetag526"></a><a href="#footnote526" title="Go to footnote 526"><span class="small">[526]</span></a></p>

<p>From Seville the Admiral was summoned to attend court at Barcelona,
where he was received with triumphal honours. He was directed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page443" name="page443"></a>(p. 443)</span> seat himself in the presence of the sovereigns, a courtesy
usually reserved for royal personages.<a id="footnotetag527" name="footnotetag527"></a><a href="#footnote527" title="Go to footnote 527"><span class="small">[527]</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Columbus is received by the sovereigns at Barcelona, April,
1493.</span>
Intense interest was felt in
his specimens of stuffed birds and small mammals, his live parrots, his
collection of herbs which he supposed to have medicinal virtues, his few
pearls and trinkets of gold, and especially his six painted and
bedizened barbarians, the survivors of ten with whom he had started from
Hispaniola. Since in the vague terminology of that time the remote and
scarcely known parts of Asia were called the Indies, and since the
islands and coasts just discovered were Indies, of course these red men
must be Indians. So Columbus had already named them in his first letter
written from the Niña, off the Azores, sent by special messenger from
Palos, and now in April, 1493, printed at Barcelona, containing the
particulars of his discovery,&mdash;a letter appropriately addressed to the
worthy Santangel but for whose timely intervention he might have ridden
many a weary league on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page444" name="page444"></a>(p. 444)</span> that mule of his to no good
purpose.<a id="footnotetag528" name="footnotetag528"></a><a href="#footnote528" title="Go to footnote 528"><span class="small">[528]</span></a> It was generally assumed without question that the
Admiral's theory of his discovery must be correct, that the coast of
Cuba must be the eastern extremity of China, that the coast of
Hispaniola must be the northern extremity of Cipango, and that a direct
route&mdash;much shorter than that which Portugal had so long been
seeking&mdash;had now been found to those lands of illimitable wealth
described by Marco Polo.<a id="footnotetag529" name="footnotetag529"></a><a href="#footnote529" title="Go to footnote 529"><span class="small">[529]</span></a> To be sure Columbus had not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page445" name="page445"></a>(p. 445)</span> as
yet seen the evidences of this Oriental splendour, and had been puzzled
at not finding them, but he felt confident that he had come very near
them and would come full upon them in a second voyage. There was nobody
who knew enough to refute these opinions,<a id="footnotetag530" name="footnotetag530"></a><a href="#footnote530" title="Go to footnote 530"><span class="small">[530]</span></a> and really why should not
this great geographer, <span class="sidenote">General excitement at the news that a way to the Indies had
been found.</span>
who had accomplished so much already which people
had scouted as impossible,&mdash;why should he not know what he was about? It
was easy enough now to get men and money for the second voyage. When the
Admiral sailed from Cadiz on September 25, 1493, it was with seventeen
ships carrying 1,500 men. Their dreams were of the marble palaces of
Quinsay, of isles of spices, and the treasures of Prester John. The
sovereigns wept for joy as they thought that such untold riches were
vouchsafed them by the special decree of Heaven, as a reward for having
overcome the Moor at Granada and banished the Jews from Spain.<a id="footnotetag531" name="footnotetag531"></a><a href="#footnote531" title="Go to footnote 531"><span class="small">[531]</span></a>
Columbus shared these views and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page446" name="page446"></a>(p. 446)</span> regarded himself as a special
instrument for executing the divine decrees. He renewed his vow to
rescue the Holy Sepulchre, promising within the next seven years to
equip at his own expense a crusading army of 50,000 foot and 4,000
horse; within five years thereafter he would follow this with a second
army of like dimensions.</p>

<p>Thus nobody had the faintest suspicion of what had been done. In the
famous letter to Santangel there is of course not a word about a New
World. The grandeur of the achievement was quite beyond the ken of the
generation that witnessed it. <span class="sidenote">This voyage was an event without any parallel in history.</span>
For we have since come to learn that in
1492 the contact between the eastern and the western halves of our
planet was first really begun, and the two streams of human life which
had flowed on for countless ages apart were thenceforth to mingle
together. The first voyage of Columbus is thus a unique event in the
history of mankind. Nothing like it was ever done before, and nothing
like it can ever be done again. No worlds are left for a future Columbus
to conquer. The era of which this great Italian mariner was the most
illustrious representative has closed forever.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE FINDING OF STRANGE COASTS.</span></h2>


<p>But that era did not close with Columbus, nor did he live long enough to
complete the Discovery of America. Our practice of affixing specific
dates to great events is on many accounts indispensable, but it is
sometimes <span class="sidenote">The Discovery of America was a gradual process.</span>
misleading. Such an event as the discovery of a pair of vast
continents does not take place within a single year. When we speak of
America as discovered in 1492, we do not mean that the moment Columbus
landed on two or three islands of the West Indies, a full outline map of
the western hemisphere from Labrador and Alaska to Cape Horn suddenly
sprang into existence&mdash;like Pallas from the forehead of Zeus&mdash;in the
minds of European men. Yet people are perpetually using arguments which
have neither force nor meaning save upon the tacit assumption that
somehow or other some such sort of thing must have happened. This
grotesque fallacy lies at the bottom of the tradition which has caused
so many foolish things to be said about that gallant mariner, Americus
Vespucius. In geographical discussions the tendency to overlook the fact
that Columbus and his immediate successors did not sail with the latest
edition of Black's General Atlas in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page448" name="page448"></a>(p. 448)</span> their cabins is almost
inveterate; it keeps revealing itself in all sorts of queer statements,
and probably there is no cure for it except in familiarity with the long
series of perplexed and struggling maps made in the sixteenth century.
Properly regarded, the Discovery of America was not a single event, but
a very gradual process. It was not like a case of special creation, for
it was a case of evolution, and the voyage of 1492 was simply the most
decisive and epoch-marking incident in that evolution. Columbus himself,
after all his four eventful voyages across the Sea of Darkness, died in
the belief that he had simply discovered the best and straightest route
to the eastern shores of Asia. Yet from his first experiences in Cuba
down to his latest voyage upon the coasts of Honduras and Veragua, he
was more or less puzzled at finding things so different from what he had
anticipated. If he had really known anything with accuracy about the
eastern coast of Asia, he would doubtless soon have detected his
fundamental error, but no European in his day had any such knowledge. In
his four voyages Columbus was finding what he supposed to be parts of
Asia, what we now know to have been parts of America, but what were
really to him and his contemporaries neither more nor less than Strange
Coasts. We have now to consider briefly his further experiences upon
these strange coasts.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second voyage of Columbus was begun in a very different mood and
under very different auspices from either his former or his two
subsequent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page449" name="page449"></a>(p. 449)</span> voyages. On his first departure from Palos, in
1492, all save a few devoted friends regarded him as a madman rushing
upon his doom; and outside the Spanish peninsula the expedition seems to
have attracted no notice. But on the second start, in 1493, all hands
supposed that they were going straight to golden Cathay and to boundless
riches. It was not now with groans but with pæans that they flocked on
board the ships; and the occasion was observed, with more or less
interest, by some people in other countries of Europe,&mdash;as in Italy, and
for the moment in France and England.</p>

<p>At the same time with his letter to Santangel, the Admiral had
despatched another account, substantially the same,<a id="footnotetag532" name="footnotetag532"></a><a href="#footnote532" title="Go to footnote 532"><span class="small">[532]</span></a> to Gabriel
<span class="sidenote">The letter to Sanchez.</span>
Sanchez,<a id="footnotetag533" name="footnotetag533"></a><a href="#footnote533" title="Go to footnote 533"><span class="small">[533]</span></a> another officer of the royal treasury. Several copies of a
Latin translation of this letter were published at Rome, at Paris, and
elsewhere, in the course of the year 1493.<a id="footnotetag534" name="footnotetag534"></a><a href="#footnote534" title="Go to footnote 534"><span class="small">[534]</span></a> The story which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page450" name="page450"></a>(p. 450)</span> it contained was at once paraphrased in Italian verse by
Giuliano Dati, one of the most popular poets of the age, and perhaps in
the autumn of 1493 the amazing news that the Indies had been found by
sailing west<a id="footnotetag535" name="footnotetag535"></a><a href="#footnote535" title="Go to footnote 535"><span class="small">[535]</span></a> was sung by street <span class="pagenum"><a id="page451" name="page451"></a>(p. 451)</span> urchins in Florence. We
are also informed, in an ill-vouched but not improbable clause in
Ramusio, that not far from that same time the news was heard with
admiration in London, where it was pronounced "a thing more divine than
human to sail by the West unto the East, where spices grow, by a way
that was never known before;"<a id="footnotetag536" name="footnotetag536"></a><a href="#footnote536" title="Go to footnote 536"><span class="small">[536]</span></a> and it seems altogether likely that
it was this news that prompted the expedition of John Cabot hereafter to
be mentioned.<a id="footnotetag537" name="footnotetag537"></a><a href="#footnote537" title="Go to footnote 537"><span class="small">[537]</span></a></p>

<p>The references to the discovery are very scanty, however, until after
the year 1500, and extremely vague withal. For example, Bernardino de
Carvajal, the Spanish ambassador at the papal court, delivered an
oration in Rome on June 19, 1493, in which he said: "And Christ placed
under their <span class="sidenote">Earliest references to the discovery.</span>
[Ferdinand and Isabella's] rule the Fortunate [Canary]
islands, the fertility of which has been ascertained to be wonderful.
And he has lately disclosed some other unknown ones towards the Indies
which may be considered among the most precious things on earth; and it
is believed that they will be gained <span class="pagenum"><a id="page452" name="page452"></a>(p. 452)</span> over to Christ by the
emissaries of the king."<a id="footnotetag538" name="footnotetag538"></a><a href="#footnote538" title="Go to footnote 538"><span class="small">[538]</span></a> Outside of the Romance countries we find
one German version of the first letter of Columbus, published at
Strasburg, in 1497,<a id="footnotetag539" name="footnotetag539"></a><a href="#footnote539" title="Go to footnote 539"><span class="small">[539]</span></a> and a brief allusion to the discovery in
Sebastian Brandt's famous allegorical poem, "Das Narrenschiff," the
first edition of which appeared in 1494.<a id="footnotetag540" name="footnotetag540"></a><a href="#footnote540" title="Go to footnote 540"><span class="small">[540]</span></a> The earliest distinct
reference to Columbus in the English language is to be found in a
translation of this poem, "The Shyppe of Fooles," by Henry Watson,
published in London by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509. <span class="sidenote">Earliest reference in English.</span>
The purpose of Brandt's
allegory was to satirize the follies committed by all sorts and
conditions of men. In the chapter, "Of hym that wyll wryte and enquere
of all regyons," it is said: "There was one that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page453" name="page453"></a>(p. 453)</span> knewe that in
y<sup>e</sup> ysles of Spayne was enhabitantes. Wherefore he asked men of Kynge
Ferdynandus &amp; wente &amp; founde them, the whiche lyved as beestes."<a id="footnotetag541" name="footnotetag541"></a><a href="#footnote541" title="Go to footnote 541"><span class="small">[541]</span></a>
Until after the middle of the sixteenth century no English chronicler
mentions either Columbus or the Cabots, nor is there anywhere an
indication that the significance of the discoveries in the western ocean
was at all understood.<a id="footnotetag542" name="footnotetag542"></a><a href="#footnote542" title="Go to footnote 542"><span class="small">[542]</span></a></p>

<p>North of the Alps and Pyrenees the interest in what was going on at the
Spanish court in 1493 was probably confined to very few people. As for
Venice and Genoa we have no adequate means of knowing how they felt
about the matter,&mdash;a fact which in itself is significant. The interest
was centred in Spain and Portugal. There it was intense and awakened
fierce heart-burnings. Though John II. had not given his consent to the
proposal for murdering Columbus, he appears to have seriously
entertained the thought of <span class="sidenote">Portuguese claim to the Indies.</span>
sending a small fleet across the Atlantic as
soon as possible, to take possession of some point in Cathay or Cipango
and then dispute the claims of the Spaniards.<a id="footnotetag543" name="footnotetag543"></a><a href="#footnote543" title="Go to footnote 543"><span class="small">[543]</span></a> Such a summary
proceeding might perhaps be defended on the ground that the grant from
Pope Eugenius V. to the crown of Portugal expressly included "the
Indies." In the treaty of 1479, moreover, Spain had promised not to
interfere with the discoveries and possessions of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>But whatever King John may have intended, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page454" name="page454"></a>(p. 454)</span> Ferdinand and
Isabella were too quick for him. No sooner had Columbus arrived at
Barcelona than an embassy was despatched to Rome, asking for a grant of
the Indies just discovered by that navigator in the service of Castile.
The notorious Rodrigo Borgia, who had lately been placed in the
apostolic chair as Alexander VI., was a native of Valencia in the
kingdom of Aragon, and would not be likely to refuse such a request
through any excess of regard for Portugal. <span class="sidenote">Bulls of Pope Alexander VI.</span>
As between the two rival
powers the pontiff's arrangement was made in a spirit of even-handed
justice. On the 3d of May, 1493, he issued a bull conferring upon the
Spanish sovereigns all lands already discovered or thereafter to be
discovered in the western ocean, with jurisdiction and privileges in all
respects similar to those formerly bestowed upon the crown of Portugal.
This grant was made by the pope "out of our pure liberality, certain
knowledge, and plenitude of apostolic power," and by virtue of "the
authority of omnipotent God granted to us in St. Peter, and of the
Vicarship of Jesus Christ which we administer upon the earth."<a id="footnotetag544" name="footnotetag544"></a><a href="#footnote544" title="Go to footnote 544"><span class="small">[544]</span></a> It
was a substantial reward for the monarchs who had completed the
overthrow of Mahometan rule in Spain, and it afforded them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page455" name="page455"></a>(p. 455)</span>
opportunities for further good work in converting the heathen
inhabitants of the islands and mainland of Asia.<a id="footnotetag545" name="footnotetag545"></a><a href="#footnote545" title="Go to footnote 545"><span class="small">[545]</span></a></p>

<p>On the following day Alexander issued a second bull in order to prevent
any occasion for quarrel between Spain and Portugal.<a id="footnotetag546" name="footnotetag546"></a><a href="#footnote546" title="Go to footnote 546"><span class="small">[546]</span></a> He decreed
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page456" name="page456"></a>(p. 456)</span> all lands discovered or to be discovered to the west of a
meridian one hundred leagues west of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page457" name="page457"></a>(p. 457)</span> the Azores and Cape Verde
islands should belong to the Spaniards. Inasmuch as between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page458" name="page458"></a>(p. 458)</span> westernmost of the Azores and the easternmost of the Cape
Verde group the difference in longitude is not far from ten degrees,
this description must be allowed to be somewhat vague, especially in a
document emanating from "certain knowledge;"<a id="footnotetag547" name="footnotetag547"></a><a href="#footnote547" title="Go to footnote 547"><span class="small">[547]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page459" name="page459"></a>(p. 459)</span> and it left
open a source of future disputes which one would suppose the "plenitude
of apostolic power" might have been worthily employed in closing. The
meridian 25° W., however, would have satisfied the conditions, and the
equitable intent of the arrangement is manifest. The Portuguese were
left free to pursue their course of discovery and conquest along the
routes which they had always preferred. King John, however, was not
satisfied. He entertained vague hopes of finding spice islands, or
something worth having, in the western waters; and he wished to have the
Line of Demarcation carried farther to the west. After a year of
diplomatic wrangling a treaty was signed at <span class="sidenote">Treaty of Tordesillas.</span>
Tordesillas, June 7, 1494,
in which Spain consented to the moving of the line to a distance of 370
leagues west from the Cape Verde islands.<a id="footnotetag548" name="footnotetag548"></a><a href="#footnote548" title="Go to footnote 548"><span class="small">[548]</span></a> It would thus on a modern
map fall somewhere between the 41st and 44th meridians west of
Greenwich. This amendment had important and curious consequences. It
presently gave the Brazilian coast to the Portuguese, and thereupon
played a leading part in the singular and complicated series of events
that ended in giving the name of Americus Vespucius to that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page460" name="page460"></a>(p. 460)</span>
region, whence it was afterwards gradually extended to the whole western
hemisphere.<a id="footnotetag549" name="footnotetag549"></a><a href="#footnote549" title="Go to footnote 549"><span class="small">[549]</span></a></p>

<hr>

<p>Already in April, 1493, without waiting for the papal sanction,
Ferdinand and Isabella bent all their energies to the work of fitting
out an expedition for taking possession of "the Indies." First, a
department of Indian affairs was created, <span class="sidenote">Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca.</span>
and at its head was placed
Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca, archdeacon of Seville: in Spain a man in high
office was apt to be a clergyman. This Fonseca was all-powerful in
Indian affairs for the next thirty years. He won and retained the
confidence of the sovereigns by virtue of his executive ability. He was
a man of coarse fibre, ambitious and domineering, cold-hearted and
perfidious, with a cynical contempt&mdash;such as low-minded people are apt
to call "smart"&mdash;for the higher human feelings. He was one of those ugly
customers who crush, without a twinge of compunction, whatever comes in
their way. The slightest opposition made him furious, and his
vindictiveness was insatiable. This dexterous and pushing Fonseca held
one after another the bishoprics of Badajoz, Cordova, Palencia, and
Conde, the archbishopric of Rosano in Italy, together with the bishopric
of Burgos, and he was also principal chaplain to Isabella and afterwards
to Ferdinand. As Sir Arthur Helps observes, "the student of early
American history will have a bad opinion of many Spanish bishops, if he
does not discover that it is Bishop Fonseca who reappears <span class="pagenum"><a id="page461" name="page461"></a>(p. 461)</span>
under various designations."<a id="footnotetag550" name="footnotetag550"></a><a href="#footnote550" title="Go to footnote 550"><span class="small">[550]</span></a> Sir Arthur fitly calls him "the
ungodly bishop."</p>

<p>The headquarters of Fonseca and of the Indian department were
established at Seville, and a special Indian custom-house was set up at
Cadiz. There was to be another custom-house upon the island of
Hispaniola (supposed to be Japan), and a minute registry was to be kept
of all ships and their crews and cargoes, going out or coming in. Nobody
was to be allowed to go to the Indies for any purpose whatever without a
license formally obtained. Careful regulations were made for hampering
trade and making everything as vexatious as possible for traders,
according to the ordinary wisdom of governments in such matters. All
expenses were to be borne and all profits received by the crown of
Castile, saving the rights formerly guaranteed to Columbus. The cost of
the present expedition was partly defrayed with stolen money, the
plunder wrung from the worthy and industrious Jews who had been driven
from their homes by the infernal edict of the year before. Extensive
"requisitions" were also made; in other words, when the sovereigns
wanted a ship or a barrel of gunpowder they seized it, and impressed it
into the good work of converting the heathen. To superintend this
missionary work, a Franciscan monk<a id="footnotetag551" name="footnotetag551"></a><a href="#footnote551" title="Go to footnote 551"><span class="small">[551]</span></a> was selected who had lately
distinguished <span class="pagenum"><a id="page462" name="page462"></a>(p. 462)</span> himself as a diplomatist in the dispute with
France over the border province of <span class="sidenote">Friar Boyle.</span>
Rousillon. This person was a native
of Catalonia, and his name was Bernardo Boyle, which strongly suggests
an Irish origin. Alexander VI. appointed him his apostolic vicar for the
Indies,<a id="footnotetag552" name="footnotetag552"></a><a href="#footnote552" title="Go to footnote 552"><span class="small">[552]</span></a> and he seems to have been the first clergyman to perform
mass on the western shores of the Atlantic. To assist the vicar, the six
Indians brought over by Columbus were baptized at Barcelona, with the
king and queen for their godfather and godmother. It was hoped that they
would prove useful as missionaries, and when one of them presently died
he was said to be the first Indian ever admitted to heaven.<a id="footnotetag553" name="footnotetag553"></a><a href="#footnote553" title="Go to footnote 553"><span class="small">[553]</span></a></p>

<p>The three summer months were occupied in fitting out the little fleet.
There were fourteen caravels, and three larger store-ships known as
carracks. Horses, mules, and other cattle were put on board,<a id="footnotetag554" name="footnotetag554"></a><a href="#footnote554" title="Go to footnote 554"><span class="small">[554]</span></a> as
well as vines and sugar-canes, and the seeds of several European
cereals, for it was intended to establish a permanent colony upon
Hispaniola. In the course of this work some slight matters of
disagreement came up between Columbus and Fonseca, and the question
having been referred to the sovereigns, Fonseca was mildly snubbed and
told that he must in all respects be guided by the Admiral's wishes.
From that time forth this ungodly prelate nourished a deadly hatred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page463" name="page463"></a>(p. 463)</span> toward Columbus, and never lost an opportunity for whispering
evil things about him. The worst of the grievous afflictions that
afterward beset the great discoverer must be ascribed to the secret
machinations of this wretch.</p>

<p>At last the armament was ready. People were so eager to embark that it
was felt necessary to restrain them. It was not intended to have more
than 1,200, but about 1,500 in all contrived to go, so that some of the
caravels must have been overcrowded. The character of the company was
very different from that of the year before. Those who went in the first
voyage were chiefly common sailors. Now there were many aristocratic
young men, hot-blooded and feather-headed hidalgos whom the surrender of
Granada had left without an occupation. Most distinguished among these
was <span class="sidenote">Notable persons who embarked on the second voyage.</span>
Alonso de Ojeda, a dare-devil of unrivalled muscular strength, full
of energy and fanfaronade, and not without generous qualities, but with
very little soundness of judgment or character. Other notable personages
in this expedition were Columbus's youngest brother Giacomo (henceforth
called Diego), who had come from Genoa at the first news of the
Admiral's triumphant return; the monk Antonio de Marchena,<a id="footnotetag555" name="footnotetag555"></a><a href="#footnote555" title="Go to footnote 555"><span class="small">[555]</span></a> whom
historians have so long confounded with the prior Juan Perez; an
Aragonese gentleman named Pedro Margarite, a favourite of the king and
destined to work sad mischief; Juan <span class="pagenum"><a id="page464" name="page464"></a>(p. 464)</span> Ponce de Leon, who
afterwards gave its name to Florida; Francisco de Las Casas, father of
the great apostle and historian of the Indies; and, last but not least,
the pilot Juan de La Cosa, now charged with the work of chart-making, in
which he was an acknowledged master.<a id="footnotetag556" name="footnotetag556"></a><a href="#footnote556" title="Go to footnote 556"><span class="small">[556]</span></a></p>

<p>The pomp and bustle of the departure from Cadiz, September 25, 1493, at
which the Admiral's two sons, Diego and Ferdinand, were present, must
have been one of the earliest recollections of the younger boy, then
just five years of age.<a id="footnotetag557" name="footnotetag557"></a><a href="#footnote557" title="Go to footnote 557"><span class="small">[557]</span></a> Again Columbus stopped at the Canary
islands, this time to take on board goats and sheep, pigs and fowls, for
he had been struck by the absence of all such animals on the coasts
which he had visited.<a id="footnotetag558" name="footnotetag558"></a><a href="#footnote558" title="Go to footnote 558"><span class="small">[558]</span></a> Seeds of melons, oranges, and lemons were
also taken. On the 7th of October the ships weighed anchor, heading a
trifle to the south of west, and after a pleasant and uneventful voyage
they sighted land on the 3d of November.<a id="footnotetag559" name="footnotetag559"></a><a href="#footnote559" title="Go to footnote 559"><span class="small">[559]</span></a> It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page465" name="page465"></a>(p. 465)</span> turned out to
be a small mountainous island, and as it was discovered on Sunday they
called it Dominica. In a fortnight's cruise in these Caribbean waters
they discovered and named several islands, such as Marigalante,
Guadaloupe, Antigua, and others, and at length reached Porto
Rico. <span class="sidenote">Cruise among the cannibal islands.</span>
The
inhabitants of these islands were ferocious cannibals, very different
from the natives encountered on the former voyage. There were skirmishes
in which a few Spaniards were killed with poisoned arrows. On Guadaloupe
the natives lived in square houses made of saplings intertwined with
reeds, and on the rude porticoes attached to these houses some of the
wooden pieces were carved so as to look like serpents. In some of these
houses human limbs were hanging from the roof, cured with smoke, like
ham; and fresh pieces of human flesh were found stewing in earthen
kettles, along with the flesh of parrots. Now at length, said Peter
Martyr, was proved the truth of the stories of Polyphemus and the
Læstrygonians, and the reader must look out lest his hair stand on
end.<a id="footnotetag560" name="footnotetag560"></a><a href="#footnote560" title="Go to footnote 560"><span class="small">[560]</span></a> These western Læstrygonians were known as Caribbees,
Caribales, or Canibales, and have thus furnished an epithet which we
have since learned to apply to man-eaters the world over.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page466" name="page466"></a>(p. 466)</span>

<p>It was late at night on the 27th of November that Columbus arrived in
the harbour of La Navidad and fired a salute to arouse the attention of
the party that had been left there the year before. There was no reply
and the silence seemed fraught with evil omen. On going ashore next
morning and exploring the neighbourhood, the Spaniards came upon sights
of dismal significance. <span class="sidenote">Fate of the colony at La Navidad.</span>
The fortress was pulled to pieces and partly
burnt, the chests of provisions were broken open and emptied, tools and
fragments of European clothing were found in the houses of the natives,
and finally eleven corpses, identifiable as those of white men, were
found buried near the fort. Not one of the forty men who had been left
behind in that place ever turned up to tell the tale. The little colony
of La Navidad had been wiped out of existence. From the Indians,
however, Columbus gathered bits of information that made a sufficiently
probable story. It was a typical instance of the beginnings of
colonization in wild countries. In such instances human nature has shown
considerable uniformity. Insubordination and deadly feuds among
themselves had combined with reckless outrages upon the natives to
imperil the existence of this little party of rough sailors. The cause
to which Horace ascribes so many direful wars, both before and since the
days of fairest Helen, seems to have been the principal cause on this
occasion. At length a fierce chieftain named Caonabo, from the region of
Xaragua, had attacked the Spaniards in overwhelming force, knocked their
blockhouse about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page467" name="page467"></a>(p. 467)</span> their heads, and butchered all that were left
of them.</p>

<p>This was a gloomy welcome to the land of promise. There was nothing to
be done but to build new fortifications and found a town. The site
chosen for this new settlement, which was named <span class="sidenote">Building of Isabella.</span>
Isabella, was at a good
harbour about thirty miles east of Monte Christi. It was chosen because
Columbus understood from the natives that it was not far from there to
the gold-bearing mountains of Cibao, a name which still seemed to
signify Cipango. Quite a neat little town was presently built, with
church, marketplace, public granary, and dwelling-houses, the whole
encompassed with a stone wall. An exploring party led by Ojeda into the
mountains of Cibao found gold dust and pieces of gold ore in the beds of
the brooks, and returned elated with this discovery. Twelve of the ships
were now sent back to Spain for further supplies and reinforcements, and
<span class="sidenote">Exploration of Cibao.</span>
specimens of the gold were sent as an earnest of what was likely to be
found. At length, in March, 1494, Columbus set forth, with 400 armed
men, to explore the Cibao country. The march was full of interest. It is
upon this occasion that we first find mention of the frantic terror
manifested by Indians at the sight of horses. At first they supposed the
horse and his rider to be a kind of centaur, and when the rider
dismounted this separation of one creature into two overwhelmed them
with supernatural terror. Even when they had begun to get over this
notion they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page468" name="page468"></a>(p. 468)</span> were in dread of being eaten by the horses.<a id="footnotetag561" name="footnotetag561"></a><a href="#footnote561" title="Go to footnote 561"><span class="small">[561]</span></a>
These natives lived in houses grouped into villages, and had carved
wooden idols and rude estufas for their tutelar divinities. It was
ascertained that different tribes tried to steal each other's idols and
even fought for the possession of valuable objects of "medicine."<a id="footnotetag562" name="footnotetag562"></a><a href="#footnote562" title="Go to footnote 562"><span class="small">[562]</span></a>
Columbus observed and reported the customs of these people with some
minuteness. There was nothing that agreed with Marco Polo's descriptions
of Cipango, but so far as concerned the discovery of gold mines, the
indications were such as to leave little doubt of the success of this
reconnaissance. The Admiral now arranged his forces so as to hold the
inland regions just visited and gave the general command to Margarite,
who was to continue the work of exploration. He left his brother, Diego
Columbus, in charge of the colony, and taking three caravels set sail
from Isabella on the 24th of April, on a cruise of discovery in these
Asiatic waters.</p>

</div>

<p>A brief westward sail brought the little squadron into the Windward
Passage and in sight of Cape Mayzi, which Columbus on his first voyage
had named <span class="sidenote">Cape Alpha and Omega.</span>
Cape Alpha and Omega as being the easternmost point on the
Chinese coast. He believed that if he were to sail to the right of this
cape he should have the continent on his port side for a thousand miles
and more, as far as Quinsay and Cambaluc (Peking). If he had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page470" name="page470"></a>(p. 470)</span>
sailed in this direction and had succeeded in keeping to the east of
Florida, he would have kept a continent on his port side, and a thousand
miles would have taken him a long way toward that Vinland which our
Scandinavian friends would fondly have us believe was his secret
guiding-star, and the geographical position of which they suppose him to
have known with such astounding accuracy. But on this as on other
occasions, if the Admiral had ever received any information about
Vinland, it must be owned that he treated it very cavalierly, for he
chose the course to the left of Cape Mayzi. His decision is intelligible
if we bear in mind that he had not yet circumnavigated Hayti and was not
yet cured of his belief that its northern shore was the shore of the
great Cipango. At the same time he had seen enough on his first voyage
to convince him that the relative positions of Cipango and the mainland
of Cathay were not correctly laid down upon the Toscanelli map. He had
already inspected two or three hundred miles of the coast to the right
of Cape Mayzi without finding traces of civilization; and whenever
inquiries were made about gold or powerful kingdoms the natives
invariably pointed to the south or southwest. Columbus, therefore,
decided to try his luck in this direction. He passed to the left of Cape
Mayzi and followed the southern coast of Cuba.</p>

<p>By the 3d of May the natives were pointing so persistently to the south
and off to sea that he <span class="sidenote">Discovery of Jamaica.</span>
changed his course in that direction and soon
came upon the northern coast of the island which we still know by its
native name <span class="pagenum"><a id="page471" name="page471"></a>(p. 471)</span> Jamaica. Here he found Indians more intelligent
and more warlike than any he had as yet seen. He was especially struck
with the elegance of their canoes, some of them nearly a hundred feet in
length, carved and hollowed from the trunks of tall trees. We may
already observe that different tribes of Indians comported themselves
very differently at the first sight of white men. While the natives of
some of the islands prostrated themselves in adoration of these
sky-creatures, or behaved with a timorous politeness which the Spaniards
mistook for gentleness of disposition, in other places the red men
showed fight at once, acting upon the brute impulse to drive away
strangers. In both cases, of course, dread of the unknown was the
prompting impulse, though so differently manifested. As the Spaniards
went ashore upon Jamaica, the Indians greeted them with a shower of
javelins and for a few moments stood up against the deadly fire of the
cross-bows, but when they turned to flee, a single bloodhound, let loose
upon them, scattered them in wildest panic.<a id="footnotetag563" name="footnotetag563"></a><a href="#footnote563" title="Go to footnote 563"><span class="small">[563]</span></a></p>

<p>Finding no evidences of civilization upon this beautiful island,
Columbus turned northward and struck the Cuban coast again at the point
which still bears the name he gave it, Cape Cruz. Between the general
contour of this <span class="sidenote">Coasting the south side of Cuba.</span>
end of Cuba and that of the eastern extremity of Cathay
upon the Toscanelli map there is a curious resemblance, save that the
direction <span class="pagenum"><a id="page472" name="page472"></a>(p. 472)</span> is in the one case more east and west and in the
other more north and south. Columbus passed no cities like Zaiton, nor
cities of any sort, but when he struck into the smiling archipelago
which he called the Queen's Gardens, now known as Cayos de las Doce
Leguas, he felt sure that he was among Marco Polo's seven thousand spice
islands. On the 3d of June, at some point on the Cuban coast, probably
near Trinidad, the crops of several doves were opened and spices found
in them. None of the natives here had ever heard of an end to Cuba, and
they believed it was endless.<a id="footnotetag564" name="footnotetag564"></a><a href="#footnote564" title="Go to footnote 564"><span class="small">[564]</span></a> The next country to the west of
themselves was named Mangon, and it was inhabited by people with tails
which they carefully hid by wearing loose robes of cloth. This
information seemed decisive to Columbus. Evidently this Mangon was
Mangi, the province in which was the city of Zaiton, the province just
south of Cathay. And as for the tailed men, the book of Mandeville had a
story of some naked savages in eastern Asia who spoke of their more
civilized neighbours as wearing clothes in order to cover up some bodily
peculiarity or defect. Could there be any doubt that the Spanish
caravels had come at length to the coast of opulent Mangi?<a id="footnotetag565" name="footnotetag565"></a><a href="#footnote565" title="Go to footnote 565"><span class="small">[565]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page473" name="page473"></a>(p. 473)</span>

<p>Under the influence of this belief, when a few days later they landed in
search of fresh water, and a certain archer, on the lookout for game,
caught distant glimpses of a flock of tall white cranes feeding in an
everglade, he fled to his comrades with the story that he had seen a
party of men clad in long white tunics, and all agreed <span class="sidenote">The "people of Mangon."</span>
that these must
be the people of Mangon.<a id="footnotetag566" name="footnotetag566"></a><a href="#footnote566" title="Go to footnote 566"><span class="small">[566]</span></a> Columbus sent a small company ashore to
find them. It is needless to add that the search was fruitless, but
footprints of alligators, interpreted as footprints of griffins guarding
hoarded gold,<a id="footnotetag567" name="footnotetag567"></a><a href="#footnote567" title="Go to footnote 567"><span class="small">[567]</span></a> frightened the men back to their ships. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page474" name="page474"></a>(p. 474)</span>
From the natives, with whom the Spaniards could converse only by signs,
they seemed to learn that they were going toward the realm of Prester
John;<a id="footnotetag568" name="footnotetag568"></a><a href="#footnote568" title="Go to footnote 568"><span class="small">[568]</span></a> and in such wise did they creep along the coast to the point,
some fifty miles west of Broa Bay, where it begins to trend decidedly to
the southwest. Before they had reached Point Mangles, a hundred miles
farther on, inasmuch as they found this southwesterly trend persistent,
the proof that they were upon the coast of the Asiatic continent began
to seem complete. Columbus thought that they had passed the point (lat.
23°, long. 145° on Toscanelli's map) where the coast of Asia began to
trend steadily toward the southwest.<a id="footnotetag569" name="footnotetag569"></a><a href="#footnote569" title="Go to footnote 569"><span class="small">[569]</span></a> By pursuing this coast he felt
sure that he would eventually reach the peninsula (Malacca) which
Ptolemy, who knew of it only by vague hearsay, called the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page475" name="page475"></a>(p. 475)</span>
Golden Chersonese.<a id="footnotetag570" name="footnotetag570"></a><a href="#footnote570" title="Go to footnote 570"><span class="small">[570]</span></a> An immense idea now flitted through the mind of
Columbus. <span class="sidenote">The Golden Chersonese.</span>
If he could reach and double that peninsula he could then find
his way to the mouth of the Ganges river; thence he might cross the
Indian ocean, pass the Cape of Good Hope (for Dias had surely shown that
the way was open), and return that way to Spain after circumnavigating
the globe! But fate had reserved this achievement for another man of
great heart and lofty thoughts, a quarter of a century later, who should
indeed accomplish what Columbus dreamed, but only after crossing another
Sea of Darkness, the most stupendous body of water on our globe, the
mere existence of which until after Columbus had died no European ever
suspected.<a id="footnotetag571" name="footnotetag571"></a><a href="#footnote571" title="Go to footnote 571"><span class="small">[571]</span></a> If Columbus had now sailed about a hundred miles
farther, he would have found the end of Cuba, and might perhaps have
skirted the northern shore of Yucatan and come upon the barbaric
splendours of Uxmal and Campeche. The excitement which such news would
have caused in Spain might perhaps have changed all the rest of his life
and saved him from the worst of his troubles. But the crews were now
unwilling to go farther, and the Admiral realized that it would be
impossible to undertake such a voyage as he had in mind with no more
than their present outfit. So it was decided to return to Hispaniola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page476" name="page476"></a>(p. 476)</span> Upon consultation with La Cosa and others, it was unanimously
agreed that they were upon the coast of the continent of Asia. The
evidence seemed conclusive. From Cape Mayzi (Alpha and Omega) they had
observed, upon their own reckoning, 335 leagues, or about 1,000
geographical miles, of continuous coast running steadily in nearly the
same direction.<a id="footnotetag572" name="footnotetag572"></a><a href="#footnote572" title="Go to footnote 572"><span class="small">[572]</span></a> Clearly it was too long for the coast of an island;
and then there was the name Mangon = Mangi. The only puzzling
circumstance was that they did not find any of Marco Polo's cities. They
kept getting scraps of information which seemed to refer to gorgeous
kingdoms, but these were always in the dim distance. Still there was no
doubt that they had discovered the coast of a continent, and of course
such a continent could be nothing else but Asia!</p>

<p>Such unanimity of opinion might seem to leave nothing to be desired. But
Columbus had already met with cavillers. Before he started on this
cruise from Isabella, some impatient hidalgos, disgusted at finding much
to do and little to get, had begun to hint that the Admiral was a
humbug, and that his "Indies" were no such great affair after all. In
order to silence these ill-natured critics, he sent his notary,
accompanied by four witnesses, to every person in those three caravels,
to get a sworn statement. If anybody had a grain of doubt about this
coast being the coast of Asia, so that you could <span class="pagenum"><a id="page477" name="page477"></a>(p. 477)</span> go ashore
there and walk on dry land all the way to Spain if so disposed, let him
declare his doubts once for all, so that they might now be duly
considered. <span class="sidenote">A solemn expression of opinion.</span>
No one expressed any doubts. All declared, under oath, their
firm belief. It was then agreed that if any of the number should
thereafter deny or contradict this sworn statement, he should have his
tongue slit;<a id="footnotetag573" name="footnotetag573"></a><a href="#footnote573" title="Go to footnote 573"><span class="small">[573]</span></a> and if an officer, he should be further punished with
a fine of 10,000 maravedis, or if a sailor, with a hundred lashes. These
proceedings were embodied in a formal document, dated June 12, 1494,
which is still to be seen in the Archives of the Indies at Seville.<a id="footnotetag574" name="footnotetag574"></a><a href="#footnote574" title="Go to footnote 574"><span class="small">[574]</span></a></p>

<p>Having disposed of this solemn matter, the three caravels turned
eastward, touching at the Isle of Pines and coasting back along the
south side of Cuba. The headland where the Admiral first became
convinced of the significance of the curvature of the coast, he named
Cape of Good Hope,<a id="footnotetag575" name="footnotetag575"></a><a href="#footnote575" title="Go to footnote 575"><span class="small">[575]</span></a> believing it to be much nearer the goal which
all were seeking than the other cape of that name, discovered by Dias
seven years before.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Admiral, upon his first voyage,
<span class="sidenote">Vicissitudes of theory.</span>
had
carried home with him two theories,&mdash;first, that in the Cuban coast he
had already discovered that of the continent <span class="pagenum"><a id="page478" name="page478"></a>(p. 478)</span> of Asia, secondly
that Hispaniola was Cipango. The first theory seemed to be confirmed by
further experience; the second was now to receive a serious shock.
Leaving Cape Cruz the caravels stood over to Jamaica, leisurely explored
the southern side of that island, and as soon as adverse winds would let
them, kept on eastward till land appeared on the port bow. Nobody
recognized it until an Indian chief who had learned some Spanish hailed
them from the shore and told them it was Hispaniola. They then followed
that southern coast its whole length, discovering the tiny islands,
Beata, Saona, and Mona. Here Columbus, overcome by long-sustained
fatigue and excitement, suddenly fell into a death-like lethargy, and in
this sad condition was carried all the way to Isabella, and to his own
house, where he was put to bed. Hispaniola had thus been
circumnavigated, and either it was not Cipango or else that wonderland
must be a much smaller affair than Toscanelli and Martin Behaim had
depicted it.<a id="footnotetag576" name="footnotetag576"></a><a href="#footnote576" title="Go to footnote 576"><span class="small">[576]</span></a> There was something truly mysterious about these
Strange Coasts!</p>

<p>When Columbus, after many days, recovered consciousness, he found his
<span class="sidenote">Arrival of Bartholomew Columbus.</span>
brother Bartholomew standing by his bedside. It was six years since they
had last parted company at Lisbon, whence the younger brother started
for England, while the elder returned to Spain. The news of
Christopher's return from his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page479" name="page479"></a>(p. 479)</span> first voyage found Bartholomew
in Paris, whence he started as soon as he could for Seville, but did not
arrive there until just after the second expedition had started.
Presently the sovereigns sent him with three ships to Hispaniola, to
carry supplies to the colony; and there he arrived while the Admiral was
exploring the coast of Cuba. The meeting of the two brothers was a great
relief to both. The affection between them was very strong, and each was
a support for the other. The Admiral at once proceeded to appoint
Bartholomew to the office of Adelantado, which in this instance was
equivalent to making him governor of Hispaniola under himself, the
Viceroy of the Indies. In making this appointment Columbus seems to have
exceeded the authority granted him by the second article of his
agreement of April, 1492, with the sovereigns;<a id="footnotetag577" name="footnotetag577"></a><a href="#footnote577" title="Go to footnote 577"><span class="small">[577]</span></a> but they mended the
matter in 1497 by themselves investing Bartholomew with the office and
dignity of Adelantado.<a id="footnotetag578" name="footnotetag578"></a><a href="#footnote578" title="Go to footnote 578"><span class="small">[578]</span></a></p>

<p>Columbus was in need of all the aid he could summon, for, during his
absence, the island had become a pandemonium.
<span class="sidenote">Mutiny in Hispaniola; desertion of Boyle and Margarite.</span>
His brother Diego, a man
of refined and studious habits, who afterwards became a priest, was too
mild in disposition to govern the hot-heads who had come to Hispaniola
to get rich without labour. They would not submit to the rule of this
foreigner. Instead of doing honest work they roamed about the island,
abusing the Indians and slaying one another in silly quarrels. Chief
among <span class="pagenum"><a id="page480" name="page480"></a>(p. 480)</span> the offenders was King Ferdinand's favourite, the
commander Margarite; and he was aided and abetted by Friar Boyle. Some
time after Bartholomew's arrival, these two men of Aragon gathered about
them a party of malcontents and, seizing the ships which had brought
that mariner, sailed away to Spain. Making their way to court, they
sought pardon for thus deserting the colony, saying that duty to their
sovereigns demanded that they should bring home a report of what was
going on in the Indies. They decried the value of Columbus's
discoveries, and reminded the king that Hispaniola was taking money out
of the treasury much faster than it was putting it in; an argument well
calculated to influence Ferdinand that summer, for he was getting ready
to go to war with France over the Naples affair. Then the two recreants
poured forth a stream of accusations against the brothers Columbus, the
general purport of which was that they were gross tyrants not fit to be
trusted with the command of Spaniards.</p>

<p>No marked effect seems to have been produced by these first complaints,
but when Margarite and Boyle were once within reach of Fonseca, we need
not wonder that mischief was soon brewing. It was unfortunate for
Columbus that his work of exploration was hampered by the necessity of
founding a colony and governing a parcel of unruly men let loose in the
wilderness, far away from the powerful restraints of civilized society.
Such work required undivided attention and extraordinary talent for
command. It does not appear that Columbus was lacking in such talent. On
the contrary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page481" name="page481"></a>(p. 481)</span> both he and his brother Bartholomew seem to have
possessed it in a high degree. But the situation was desperately bad
when the spirit of mutiny was fomented by deadly enemies at court.
<span class="sidenote">The government of Columbus was not tyrannical.</span>
I do
not find adequate justification for the charges of tyranny brought
against Columbus. The veracity and fairness of the history of Las Casas
are beyond question; in his divinely beautiful spirit one sees now and
then a trace of tenderness even for Fonseca, whose conduct toward him
was always as mean and malignant as toward Columbus. One gets from Las
Casas the impression that the Admiral's high temper was usually kept
under firm control, and that he showed far less severity than most men
would have done under similar provocation. Bartholomew was made of
sterner stuff, but his whole career presents no instance of wanton
cruelty; toward both white men and Indians his conduct was distinguished
by clemency and moderation. Under the government of these brothers a few
scoundrels were hanged in Hispaniola. Many more ought to have been.</p>

<p>Of the attempt of Columbus to collect tribute from the native
population, and its <span class="sidenote">Troubles with the Indians.</span>
consequences in developing the system of
<i>repartimientos</i> out of which grew Indian slavery, I shall treat in a
future chapter.<a id="footnotetag579" name="footnotetag579"></a><a href="#footnote579" title="Go to footnote 579"><span class="small">[579]</span></a> That attempt, which was ill-advised and
ill-managed, was part of a plan for checking wanton depredations and
regulating the relations between the Spaniards and the Indians. The
colonists behaved so badly toward <span class="pagenum"><a id="page482" name="page482"></a>(p. 482)</span> the red men that the
chieftain Caonabo, who had destroyed La Navidad the year before, now
formed a scheme<a id="footnotetag580" name="footnotetag580"></a><a href="#footnote580" title="Go to footnote 580"><span class="small">[580]</span></a> for a general alliance among the native tribes,
hoping with sufficient numbers to overwhelm and exterminate the
strangers, in spite of their solid-hoofed monsters and death-dealing
thunderbolts. This scheme was revealed to Columbus, soon after his
return from the coast of Cuba, by the chieftain Guacanagari, who was an
enemy to Caonabo and courted the friendship of the Spaniards. Alonso de
Ojeda, by a daring stratagem, captured Caonabo and brought him to
Columbus, who treated him kindly but kept him a prisoner until it should
be convenient to send him to Spain. But this chieftain's scheme was
nevertheless put in operation through the influence of his principal
wife Anacaona. An Indian war broke out; roaming bands of Spaniards were
ambushed and massacred; and there was fighting in the field, where the
natives&mdash;assailed by firearms and cross-bows, horses and
bloodhounds&mdash;were wofully defeated.</p>

<p>Thus in the difficult task of controlling mutinous white men and
<span class="sidenote">Mission of Aguado.</span>
defending the colony against infuriated red men Columbus spent the first
twelvemonth after his return from Cuba. In October, 1495, there arrived
in the harbour of Isabella four caravels laden with welcome supplies. In
one of these ships came Juan Aguado, sent by the sovereigns to gather
information respecting the troubles of the colony. This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page483" name="page483"></a>(p. 483)</span>
appointment was doubtless made in a friendly spirit, for Columbus had
formerly recommended Aguado to favour. But the arrival of such a person
created a hope, which quickly grew into a belief, that the sovereigns
were preparing to deprive Columbus of the government of the island; and,
as Irving neatly says, "it was a time of jubilee for offenders; every
culprit started up into an accuser." All the ills of the colony, many of
them inevitable in such an enterprise, many of them due to the
shiftlessness and folly, the cruelty and lust of idle swash-bucklers,
were now laid at the door of Columbus. <span class="sidenote">Discovery of gold mines.</span>
Aguado was presently won over by
the malcontents, so that by the time he was ready to return to Spain,
early in 1496, Columbus felt it desirable to go along with him and make
his own explanations to the sovereigns. Fortunately for his purposes,
just before he started, some rich gold mines were discovered on the
south side of the island, in the neighbourhood of the Hayna and Ozema
rivers. Moreover there were sundry pits in these mines, which looked
like excavations and seemed to indicate that in former times there had
been digging done.<a id="footnotetag581" name="footnotetag581"></a><a href="#footnote581" title="Go to footnote 581"><span class="small">[581]</span></a> This discovery confirmed the Admiral in a new
theory, which he was beginning to form. If it should turn out that
Hispaniola was not Cipango, as the last voyage seemed to suggest,
perhaps it might prove to be Ophir!<a id="footnotetag582" name="footnotetag582"></a><a href="#footnote582" title="Go to footnote 582"><span class="small">[582]</span></a> Probably these ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page484" name="page484"></a>(p. 484)</span> excavations were made by King Solomon's men when they came
here to get gold for the temple at Jerusalem! <span class="sidenote">Speculations about Ophir.</span>
If so, one might expect to
find silver, ivory, red sandal-wood, apes, and peacocks at no great
distance. Just where Ophir was situated no one could exactly tell,<a id="footnotetag583" name="footnotetag583"></a><a href="#footnote583" title="Go to footnote 583"><span class="small">[583]</span></a>
but the things that were carried thence to Jerusalem certainly came from
"the Indies." Columbus conceived it as probably lying northeastward of
the Golden Chersonese (Malacca) and as identical with the island of
Hispaniola.</p>

<p>The discovery of these mines led to the transfer of the headquarters of
the colony to the mouth of the <span class="sidenote">Founding of San Domingo, 1496.</span>
Ozema river, where, in the summer of
1496, Bartholomew Columbus made a settlement which became the city of
San Domingo.<a id="footnotetag584" name="footnotetag584"></a><a href="#footnote584" title="Go to footnote 584"><span class="small">[584]</span></a> Meanwhile Aguado and the Admiral sailed for Spain
early in March, in two caravels overloaded with more than two hundred
homesick passengers. In choosing his course Columbus did not show so
much sagacity as on his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page485" name="page485"></a>(p. 485)</span> first return voyage. Instead of
working northward till clear of the <span class="sidenote">The return voyage.</span>
belt of trade-winds, he kept
straight to the east, and so spent a month in beating and tacking before
getting out of the Caribbean Sea. Scarcity of food was imminent, and it
became necessary to stop at Guadaloupe and make a quantity of cassava
bread.<a id="footnotetag585" name="footnotetag585"></a><a href="#footnote585" title="Go to footnote 585"><span class="small">[585]</span></a> It was well that this was done, for as the ships worked
slowly across the Atlantic, struggling against perpetual head-winds, the
provisions were at length exhausted, and by the first week in June the
famine was such that Columbus had some difficulty in preventing the
crews from eating their Indian captives, of whom there were thirty or
more on board.<a id="footnotetag586" name="footnotetag586"></a><a href="#footnote586" title="Go to footnote 586"><span class="small">[586]</span></a></p>

<p>At length, on the 11th of June, the haggard and starving company arrived
at Cadiz, and Columbus, while awaiting orders from the sovereigns,
stayed at the house of his good friend Bernaldez, the curate of Los
Palacios.<a id="footnotetag587" name="footnotetag587"></a><a href="#footnote587" title="Go to footnote 587"><span class="small">[587]</span></a> After a month he attended court at Burgos, and was kindly
received. No allusion was made to the complaints against him, and the
sovereigns promised to furnish ships for a third voyage of discovery.
For the moment, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page486" name="page486"></a>(p. 486)</span> other things interfered with this
enterprise. One was the marriage of the son and daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella to the daughter and son of the Emperor Maximilian. The war
with France was at the same time fast draining the treasury. Indeed, for
more than twenty years, Castile had been at war nearly all the time,
first with Portugal, next with Granada, then with France; and the crown
never found it easy to provide money for maritime enterprises.
Accordingly, at the earnest solicitation of Vicente Yañez Pinzon and
other enterprising mariners, the sovereigns had issued a proclamation,
<span class="sidenote">Edicts of 1495 and 1497.</span>
April 10, 1495, granting to all native Spaniards the privilege of
making, at their own risk and expense, voyages of discovery or traffic
to the newly found coasts. As the crown was to take a pretty heavy
tariff out of the profits of these expeditions, while all losses were to
be borne by the adventurers, a fairly certain source of revenue, be it
great or small, seemed likely to be opened.<a id="footnotetag588" name="footnotetag588"></a><a href="#footnote588" title="Go to footnote 588"><span class="small">[588]</span></a> Columbus protested
against <span class="pagenum"><a id="page487" name="page487"></a>(p. 487)</span> this edict, inasmuch as he deemed himself entitled to
a patent or monopoly in the work of conducting expeditions to Cathay.
The sovereigns evaded the difficulty by an edict of June 2, 1497,
declaring that it was never their intention "in any way to affect the
rights of the said Don Christopher Columbus." This declaration was,
doubtless, intended simply to pacify the Admiral. It did not prevent the
authorization of voyages conducted by other persons a couple of years
later; and, as I shall show in the next chapter, there are strong
reasons for believing that on May 10, 1497, three weeks before this
edict, an expedition sailed from Cadiz under the especial auspices of
King Ferdinand, with Vicente Yañez Pinzon for its chief commander and
Americus Vespucius for one of its pilots.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the spring of 1498 that the ships were ready
for Columbus. Everything that <span class="sidenote">Columbus loses his temper.</span>
Fonseca could do to vex and delay him was
done. One of the bishop's minions, a converted Moor or Jew named Ximeno
Breviesca, behaved with such outrageous insolence that on the day of
sailing the Admiral's indignation, so long restrained, at last broke
out, and he drove away the fellow with kicks and cuffs.<a id="footnotetag589" name="footnotetag589"></a><a href="#footnote589" title="Go to footnote 589"><span class="small">[589]</span></a> This
imprudent act gave Fonseca the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page488" name="page488"></a>(p. 488)</span> opportunity to maintain that
what the Admiral's accusers said about his tyrannical disposition must
be true.</p>

<hr>

<p>The expedition started on May 30, 1498, from the little port of San
Lucar de Barrameda. <span class="sidenote">The third voyage.</span>
There were six ships, carrying about 200 men besides
the sailors. On June 21, at the Isle of Ferro, the Admiral divided his
fleet, sending three ships directly to Hispaniola, while with the other
three he kept on to the Cape Verde islands, whence he steered southwest
on the 4th of July. A week later, after a run of about 900 miles, his
astrolabe seemed to show that he was within five degrees of the
equator.<a id="footnotetag590" name="footnotetag590"></a><a href="#footnote590" title="Go to footnote 590"><span class="small">[590]</span></a> There were three reasons for going so far to the
south:&mdash;1, the natives of the islands already visited always <span class="pagenum"><a id="page489" name="page489"></a>(p. 489)</span>
pointed in that direction when gold was mentioned; 2, a learned
jeweller, who had travelled in the East, had assured Columbus that gold
and gems, as well as spices and rare drugs, were to be found for the
most part among black people near the equator; 3, if he should not find
any rich islands on the way, a sufficiently long voyage would bring him
to the coast of Champa (Cochin China) at a lower point than he had
reached on the preceding voyage, and nearer to the Golden Chersonese
(Malacca), by doubling which he could enter the Indian ocean. It will be
remembered that he supposed the southwesterly curve in the Cuban coast,
the farthest point reached in his second voyage, to be the beginning of
the coast of Cochin China according to Marco Polo.</p>

<p>Once more through ignorance of the atmospheric conditions of the regions
within the tropics Columbus encountered needless perils and hardships.
If he had steered from Ferro straight across the ocean a trifle south of
west-southwest, he might have made a quick and comfortable voyage, with
the trade-wind filling his sails, to the spot where he actually struck
land.<a id="footnotetag591" name="footnotetag591"></a><a href="#footnote591" title="Go to footnote 591"><span class="small">[591]</span></a>
As it was, however, he naturally followed the custom then so
common, <span class="sidenote">The belt of calms.</span>
of first running to the parallel upon which he intended to sail.
This long southerly run brought him into the belt of calms or neutral
zone between the northern and southern trade-winds, a little north of
the equator.<a id="footnotetag592" name="footnotetag592"></a><a href="#footnote592" title="Go to footnote 592"><span class="small">[592]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page490" name="page490"></a>(p. 490)</span> No words can describe what followed so well
as those of Irving: "The wind suddenly fell, and a dead sultry calm
commenced, which lasted for eight days. The air was like a furnace; the
tar melted, the seams of the ship yawned; the salt meat became putrid;
the wheat was parched as if with fire; the hoops shrank from the wine
and water casks, some of which leaked and others burst, while the heat
in the holds of the vessels was so suffocating that no one could remain
below a sufficient time to prevent the damage that was taking place. The
mariners lost all strength and spirits, and sank under the oppressive
heat. It seemed as if the old fable of the torrid zone was about to be
realized; and that they were approaching a fiery region where it would
be impossible to exist."<a id="footnotetag593" name="footnotetag593"></a><a href="#footnote593" title="Go to footnote 593"><span class="small">[593]</span></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, they were in a region where the ocean is comparatively
narrow. The longitude reached by Columbus on July 13, when the wind died
away, must have been about 36° or 37° W., <span class="pagenum"><a id="page491" name="page491"></a>(p. 491)</span> and a run of only
800 miles west from that point would have brought him to Cayenne. His
course between the 13th and 21st of July must have intersected the
thermal equator, or line of greatest mean annual heat on the globe,&mdash;an
irregular curve which is here deflected as much as five degrees north of
the equinoctial line. But although there was not a breath of wind, the
powerful equatorial current was quietly driving the ships, much faster
than the Admiral could have suspected, to the northwest and toward land.
By the end of that stifling week they were in latitude 7° N., and caught
the trade-wind on the starboard quarter. Thence after a brisk run of ten
days, in sorry plight, with ugly leaks and scarcely a cask of fresh
water left, they arrived within sight of land. Three mountain peaks
loomed up in the offing before them, and as they drew nearer it appeared
that those peaks belonged to one great mountain; wherefore the pious
Admiral named the island Trinidad.</p>

<p>Here some surprises were in store for Columbus. Instead of finding black
and woolly-haired natives, he found men of cinnamon hue, like those in
Hispaniola, <span class="sidenote">Trinidad and the Orinoco.</span>
only&mdash;strange to say&mdash;lighter in colour. Then in coasting
Trinidad he caught a glimpse of land at the delta of the Orinoco, and
called it Isla Santa, or Holy Island.<a id="footnotetag594" name="footnotetag594"></a><a href="#footnote594" title="Go to footnote 594"><span class="small">[594]</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page492" name="page492"></a>(p. 492)</span> But, on passing
into the gulf of Paria, through the strait which he named Serpent's
Mouth, his ships were in sore danger of being swamped by the raging
surge that poured from three or four of the lesser mouths of that
stupendous river. Presently, finding that the water in the gulf was
fresh to the taste, he gradually reasoned his way to the correct
conclusion, that the billows which had so nearly overwhelmed him must
have come out from a river greater than any he had ever known or dreamed
of, and that so vast a stream of running water could be produced only
upon land of continental dimensions.<a id="footnotetag595" name="footnotetag595"></a><a href="#footnote595" title="Go to footnote 595"><span class="small">[595]</span></a> This coast to the south of him
was, therefore, the coast of a continent, with indefinite extension
toward the south, a land not laid down upon Toscanelli's or any other
map, and of which no one had until that time known anything.<a id="footnotetag596" name="footnotetag596"></a><a href="#footnote596" title="Go to footnote 596"><span class="small">[596]</span></a></p>

<p>Discoveries made by Columbus in his third and
fourth voyages.</p>
</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page494" name="page494"></a>(p. 494)</span>

<p>In spite of the correctness of this surmise, Columbus was still as far
from a true interpretation of the whole situation as when he supposed
Hispaniola to be Ophir. He entered upon a series of speculations which
forcibly remind us how empirical was the notion of the earth's rotundity
before the inauguration of physical astronomy by <span class="sidenote">Speculations as to the earth's shape.</span>
Galileo, Kepler, and
Newton. We now know that our planet has the only shape possible for such
a rotating mass that once was fluid or nebulous, the shape of a spheroid
slightly protuberant at the equator and flattened at the poles; but this
knowledge is the outcome of mechanical principles utterly unknown and
unsuspected in the days of Columbus. He understood that the earth is a
round body, but saw no necessity for its being strictly spherical or
spheroidal. He now suggested that it was probably shaped like a pear,
rather a blunt and corpulent pear, nearly spherical in its lower part,
but with a short, stubby apex in the equatorial region somewhere beyond
the point which he had just reached. He fancied he had been sailing up a
gentle slope from the burning glassy sea where his ships had been
becalmed to this strange and beautiful coast where <span class="sidenote">The mountain of Paradise.</span>
he found the climate
enchanting. If he were to follow up the mighty river just now revealed,
it might lead him to the summit of this apex of the world, the place
where the terrestrial paradise, the Garden which the Lord <span class="pagenum"><a id="page495" name="page495"></a>(p. 495)</span>
planted eastward in Eden, was in all probability situated!<a id="footnotetag597" name="footnotetag597"></a><a href="#footnote597" title="Go to footnote 597"><span class="small">[597]</span></a></p>

<p>As Columbus still held to the opinion that by keeping to the west from
that point he should soon reach the coast of <span class="sidenote">Relation of the "Eden continent" to "Cochin China."</span>
Cochin China, his
conception of the position of Eden is thus pretty clearly indicated. He
imagined it as situated about on the equator, upon a continental mass
till then unknown, but evidently closely connected with the continent of
Asia if not a part of it. If he had lived long enough to hear of Quito
and its immense elevation, I should suppose that might very well have
suited his idea of the position of Eden. The coast of this continent,
upon which he had now arrived, was either continuous with the coast of
Cochin China (Cuba) and Malacca, or would be found to be divided from it
by a strait through which one might pass directly into the Indian ocean.</p>


<p>It took some little time for this theory to come to maturity in the mind
of Columbus. Not expecting to find any mainland in that <span class="sidenote">The Pearl Coast.</span>
quarter, he
began by calling different points of the coast different islands. Coming
out through the passage which he named Dragon's Mouth, he caught distant
glimpses of Tobago and Grenada to starboard, and turning westward
followed the Pearl Coast as far as the islands of Margarita and Cubagua.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page496" name="page496"></a>(p. 496)</span> The fine pearls which he found there in abundance confirmed
him in the good opinion he had formed of that country. By this time, the
15th of August, he had so far put facts together as to become convinced
of the continental character of that coast, and would have been glad to
pursue it westward. But now his strength gave out. During most of the
voyage he had suffered acute torments with gout, his temperature had
been very feverish, and his eyes were at length so exhausted with
perpetual watching that he could no longer make observations. So he left
the coast a little beyond Cubagua, and steered straight for Hispaniola,
aiming at <span class="sidenote">Arrival at San Domingo.</span>
San Domingo, but hitting the island of Beata because he did
not make allowance for the westerly flow of the currents. He arrived at
San Domingo on the 30th of August, and found his brother Bartholomew,
whom he intended to send at once on a further cruise along the Pearl
Coast, while he himself should be resting and recovering strength.</p>

<p>But alas! there was to be no cruising now for the younger brother nor
rest for the elder. It was a sad story that <span class="sidenote">Roldan's rebellion.</span>
Bartholomew had to tell. War
with the Indians had broken out afresh, and while the Adelantado was
engaged in this business a scoundrel named Roldan had taken advantage of
his absence to stir up civil strife. Roldan's rebellion was a result of
the ill-advised mission of Aguado. The malcontents in the colony
interpreted the Admiral's long stay in Spain as an indication that he
had lost favour with the sovereigns and was not coming back to the
island. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page497" name="page497"></a>(p. 497)</span> Gathering together a strong body of rebels, Roldan
retired to Xaragua and formed an alliance with the brother of the late
chieftain Caonabo. By the time the Admiral arrived the combination of
mutiny with barbaric warfare had brought about a frightful state of
things. A party of soldiers, sent by him to suppress Roldan, straightway
deserted and joined that rebel. It thus became necessary to come to
terms with Roldan, and this revelation of the weakness of the government
only made matters worse. Two wretched years were passed in attempts to
restore order in Hispaniola, while the work of discovery and exploration
was postponed. Meanwhile the items of information that found their way
to Spain were skilfully employed by <span class="sidenote">Fonseca's machinations.</span>
Fonseca in poisoning the minds of
the sovereigns, until at last they decided to send out a judge to the
island, armed with plenary authority to make investigations and settle
disputes. The glory which Columbus had won by the first news of the
discovery of the Indies had now to some extent faded away. The
enterprise yielded as yet no revenue and entailed great expense; and
whenever some reprobate found his way back to Spain, the malicious
Fonseca prompted him to go to the treasury with a claim for pay alleged
to have been wrongfully withheld by the Admiral. Ferdinand Columbus
tells how some fifty such scamps were gathered one day in the courtyard
of the Alhambra, cursing his father and catching hold of the king's
robe, crying, "Pay us! pay us!" and as he and his brother Diego, who
were pages in the queen's service, happened <span class="pagenum"><a id="page498" name="page498"></a>(p. 498)</span> to pass by, they
were greeted with hoots:&mdash;"There go the sons of the Admiral of
Mosquito-land, the man who has discovered a land of vanity and deceit,
the grave of Spanish gentlemen!"<a id="footnotetag598" name="footnotetag598"></a><a href="#footnote598" title="Go to footnote 598"><span class="small">[598]</span></a></p>

<p>An added sting was given to such taunts by a great event that happened
about this time. In the summer of <span class="sidenote">Gama's voyage to Hindustan, 1497.</span>
1497, Vasco da Gama started from
Lisbon for the Cape of Good Hope, and in the summer of 1499 he returned,
after having doubled the cape and crossed the Indian ocean to Calicut on
the Malabar coast of Hindustan. His voyage was the next Portuguese step
sequent upon that of Bartholomew Dias. There was nothing questionable or
dubious about Gama's triumph. He had seen splendid cities, talked with a
powerful Rajah, and met with Arab vessels, their crews madly jealous at
the unprecedented sight of Christian ships in those waters; and he
brought back with him to Lisbon nutmegs and cloves, pepper and ginger,
rubies and emeralds, damask robes with satin linings, bronze chairs with
cushions, trumpets of carved ivory, a sunshade of crimson satin, a sword
in a silver scabbard, and no end of such gear.<a id="footnotetag599" name="footnotetag599"></a><a href="#footnote599" title="Go to footnote 599"><span class="small">[599]</span></a> An old civilization
had been found and a route of commerce discovered, and a factory was to
be set up at once on that Indian coast. What a contrast to the miserable
performance of Columbus, who had started with the flower of Spain's
chivalry for rich Cipango, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page499" name="page499"></a>(p. 499)</span> and had only led them to a land
where they must either starve or do work fit for peasants, while he
spent his time in cruising among wild islands! The king of Portugal
could now snap his fingers at Ferdinand and Isabella, and if a doubt
should have sometimes crossed the minds of those chagrined sovereigns,
as to whether this plausible Genoese mariner might not, after all, be a
humbug or a crazy enthusiast, we can hardly wonder at it.</p>

<p>The person sent to investigate the affairs of Hispaniola was Francisco
de Bobadilla, a knight commander of the order of Calatrava. He carried
several <span class="sidenote">Fonseca's creature, Bobadilla.</span>
documents, one of them directing him to make inquiries and
punish offenders, another containing his appointment as governor, a
third commanding Columbus and his brothers to surrender to him all
fortresses and other public property.<a id="footnotetag600" name="footnotetag600"></a><a href="#footnote600" title="Go to footnote 600"><span class="small">[600]</span></a> The two latter papers were to
be used only in case of such grave misconduct proved against Columbus as
to justify his removal from the government. These papers were made out
in the spring of 1499, but Bobadilla was not sent out until July, 1500.
When he arrived at San Domingo on the 23d of August, the insurrection
had been suppressed; the Admiral and Bartholomew were bringing things
into order in distant parts of the island, while Diego was left in
command at San Domingo. Seven ringleaders had just been hanged, and five
more were in prison under sentence of death. If Bobadilla had not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page500" name="page500"></a>(p. 500)</span> come upon the scene this wholesome lesson might have worked
some improvement in affairs.<a id="footnotetag601" name="footnotetag601"></a><a href="#footnote601" title="Go to footnote 601"><span class="small">[601]</span></a> He destroyed its moral in a twinkling.
The first day after landing, he read aloud, at the church door, the
paper directing him to make inquiries and punish offenders; and
forthwith demanded of Diego Columbus that the condemned prisoners should
be delivered up to him. Diego declined to take so important a step until
he could get orders from the Admiral. Next day Bobadilla read his second
and third papers, proclaimed himself governor, called on Diego to
surrender the fortress and public buildings, and renewed his demand for
the prisoners. As Diego still hesitated to act before news of these
proceedings could be sent to his brother, Bobadilla broke into the
fortress, took the prisoners out, and presently set them free. All the
rebellious spirits in the colony were thus drawn to the side of
Bobadilla, whose royal commission, under such circumstances, gave him
irresistible power. He threw Diego into prison and loaded him with
fetters. He seized the Admiral's house, and confiscated all his personal
property, even including his business papers and private letters. When
the Admiral arrived in San Domingo, Bobadilla, <span class="sidenote">Columbus in chains.</span>
without even waiting to
see him, sent an officer to put him in irons and take him to prison.
When Bartholomew arrived, he received the same treatment. The three
brothers were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page501" name="page501"></a>(p. 501)</span> confined in different places, nobody was allowed
to visit them, and they were not informed of the offences with which
they were charged. While they lay in prison, Bobadilla busied himself
with inventing an excuse for this violent behaviour. Finally he hit upon
one at which Satan from the depths of his bottomless pit must have
grimly smiled. He said that he had arrested and imprisoned the brothers
only because he had reason to believe they were inciting the Indians to
aid them in resisting the commands of Ferdinand and Isabella!! In short,
from the day of his landing Bobadilla made common cause with the
insurgent rabble, and when they had furnished him with a ream or so of
charges against the Admiral and his brothers, it seemed safe to send
these gentlemen to Spain. They were put on board ship, with their
fetters upon them, and the officer in charge was instructed by Bobadilla
to deliver them into the hands of Bishop Fonseca, who was thus to have
the privilege of glutting to the full his revengeful spite.</p>

<p>The master of the ship, shocked at the sight of fetters upon such a man
as the Admiral, would have taken them off, but <span class="sidenote">Return to Spain.</span>
Columbus would not let it
be done. No, indeed! they should never come off except by order of the
sovereigns, and then he would keep them for the rest of his life, to
show how his labours had been rewarded.<a id="footnotetag602" name="footnotetag602"></a><a href="#footnote602" title="Go to footnote 602"><span class="small">[602]</span></a> The event&mdash;which always
justifies true manliness&mdash;proved the sagacity of this proud <span class="pagenum"><a id="page502" name="page502"></a>(p. 502)</span>
demeanour. Fonseca was baulked of his gratification. The clumsy
Bobadilla had overdone the business. The sight of the Admiral's stately
and venerable figure in chains, as he passed through the streets of
Cadiz, on a December day of that year 1500, awakened a popular outburst
of sympathy for him and indignation at his persecutors. While on the
ship he had written or dictated a beautiful and touching letter<a id="footnotetag603" name="footnotetag603"></a><a href="#footnote603" title="Go to footnote 603"><span class="small">[603]</span></a> to
a lady of whom the queen was fond, the former nurse of the Infante,
whose untimely death, three years since, his mother was still mourning.
This letter reached the court at Granada, and was read to the queen
before she had heard of Bobadilla's performances from any other quarter.
A courier was sent in all haste to Cadiz, with orders that the brothers
should at once be released, and with a letter to the Admiral, inviting
him to court and enclosing an order for money to cover his expenses.
<span class="sidenote">Release of Columbus.</span>
The
scene in the Alhambra, when Columbus arrived, is one of the most
touching in history. Isabella received him with tears in her eyes, and
then this much-enduring old man, whose proud and masterful spirit had so
long been proof against all wrongs and insults, broke down. He threw
himself at the feet of the sovereigns in an agony of tears and
sobs.<a id="footnotetag604" name="footnotetag604"></a><a href="#footnote604" title="Go to footnote 604"><span class="small">[604]</span></a></p>

<p>How far the sovereigns should be held responsible for the behaviour of
their agent is not altogether easy to determine. The appointment of such
a creature as Bobadilla was a sad blunder, but one <span class="pagenum"><a id="page503" name="page503"></a>(p. 503)</span> such as is
liable to be made under any government.
<span class="sidenote">How far were the sovereigns responsible for Bobadilla?</span>
Fonseca was very powerful at
court, and Bobadilla never would have dared to proceed as he did if he
had not known that the bishop would support him. Indeed, from the
indecent haste with which he went about his work, without even the
pretence of a judicial inquiry, it is probable that he started with
private instructions from that quarter. But, while Fonseca had some of
the wisdom along with the venom of the serpent, Bobadilla was simply a
jackass, and behaved so that in common decency the sovereigns were
obliged to disown him. They took no formal or public notice of his
written charges against the Admiral, and they assured the latter that he
should be reimbursed for his losses and restored to his viceroyalty and
other dignities.</p>

<p>This last promise, however, was not fulfilled; partly, perhaps, because
Fonseca's influence was still strong enough to prevent it, partly
because the sovereigns may have come to the sound and reasonable
conclusion that for the present there was no use in committing the
government of that disorderly rabble in Hispaniola to a foreigner. What
was wanted was a Spanish priest, and a military priest withal, of the
sort that Spain then had in plenty. Obedience to priests came natural to
Spaniards. <span class="sidenote">Ovando, another creature of Fonseca, appointed governor of
Hispaniola.</span>
The man now selected was Nicolas de Ovando, a knight
commander of the order of Alcántara, of whom we shall have more to say
hereafter.<a id="footnotetag605" name="footnotetag605"></a><a href="#footnote605" title="Go to footnote 605"><span class="small">[605]</span></a> Suffice it now to observe that he proved himself a
famous <span class="pagenum"><a id="page504" name="page504"></a>(p. 504)</span> disciplinarian, and that he was a great favourite with
Fonseca, to whom he seems to have owed his appointment. He went out in
February, 1502, with a fleet of thirty ships carrying 2,500 persons, for
the pendulum of public opinion had taken another swing, and faith in the
Indies was renewed. Some great discoveries, to be related in the next
chapter, had been made since 1498; and, moreover, the gold mines of
Hispaniola were beginning to yield rich treasures.</p>

<p>But, while the sovereigns were not disposed to restore Columbus to his
viceroyalty, they were quite ready to send him on <span class="sidenote">Purpose of Columbus's fourth voyage.</span>
another voyage of
discovery which was directly suggested by the recent Portuguese voyage
of Gama. Since nothing was yet known about the discovery of a New World,
the achievement of Gama seemed to have eclipsed that of Columbus. Spain
must make a response to Portugal. As already observed, the Admiral
supposed the coast of his "Eden continent" (South America) either to be
continuous with the coast of Cochin China (Cuba) and Malacca, or else to
be divided from that coast by a strait. The latter opinion was the more
probable, since Marco Polo and a few other Europeans had sailed from
China into the Indian ocean without encountering any great continent
that had to be circumnavigated. The recent expedition of Vespucius and
Ojeda (1499-1500) had followed the northern coast of South America for a
long distance to the west of Cubagua, as far as the gulf of Maracaibo.
Columbus now decided to return to the coast of Cochin China (Cuba) and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page505" name="page505"></a>(p. 505)</span> follow the coast southwestward until he should find the
passage between his Eden continent and the Golden Chersonese (Malacca)
into the Indian ocean. He would thus be able to reach by this western
route the same shores of Hindustan which Gama had lately reached by
sailing eastward. So confident did he feel of the success of this
enterprise, that he wrote a letter to Pope Alexander VI., renewing his
vow to furnish troops for the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre.<a id="footnotetag606" name="footnotetag606"></a><a href="#footnote606" title="Go to footnote 606"><span class="small">[606]</span></a> It was
no doubt the symptom of a reaction against his misfortunes that he grew
more and more mystical in these days, consoling himself with the belief
that he was a chosen instrument in the hands of Providence for enlarging
the bounds of Christendom. In this mood he made some studies on the
prophecies, after the fantastic fashion of his time,<a id="footnotetag607" name="footnotetag607"></a><a href="#footnote607" title="Go to footnote 607"><span class="small">[607]</span></a> and a habit
grew upon him of attributing his discoveries to miraculous inspiration
rather than to the good use to which his poetical and scientific mind
had put the data furnished by Marco Polo and the ancient geographers.</p>

<p>The armament for the Admiral's fourth and last voyage consisted of four
small caravels, of from fifty to seventy tons burthen, with crews
numbering, all told, 150 men. <span class="sidenote">Crossing the Atlantic.</span>
His brother Bartholomew, and his younger
son Ferdinand, then a boy of fourteen, accompanied him. They sailed from
Cadiz on the 11th of May, 1502, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page506" name="page506"></a>(p. 506)</span> and finally left the Canaries
behind on the 26th of the same month. The course chosen was the same as
on the second voyage, and the unfailing trade-winds brought the ships on
the 15th of June to an island called Mantinino, probably Martinique, not
more than ten leagues distant from Dominica. The Admiral had been
instructed not to touch at Hispaniola upon his way out, probably for
fear of further commotions there until Ovando should have succeeded in
bringing order out of the confusion ten times worse confounded into
which Bobadilla's misgovernment had thrown that island. Columbus might
stop there on his return, but not on his outward voyage. His intention
had, therefore, been, on reaching the cannibal islands, to steer for
Jamaica, thence make the short run to "Cochin China," and then turn
southwards. But as one of his caravels threatened soon to become
unmanageable, he thought himself justified in touching at San Domingo
long enough to hire a sound vessel in place of her. Ovando had assumed
the government there in April, and a squadron of 26 or 28 ships,
containing Roldan and Bobadilla, with huge quantities of gold wrung from
the enslaved Indians, was ready to start for Spain about the end of
June. In one of these ships were 4,000 pieces of gold destined for
Columbus, probably a part of the reimbursement that had been promised
him. On the 29th of June the Admiral arrived in the harbour and stated
the nature of his errand. At the same time, as his practised eye had
detected the symptoms of an approaching hurricane, he requested
permission to stay in the harbour until it should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page507" name="page507"></a>(p. 507)</span> be over, and
he furthermore sent to the commander of the fleet a friendly warning not
to venture out to sea at present. His requests and his warnings were
alike treated with contumely. <span class="sidenote">Columbus not allowed to stop at San Domingo.</span>
He was ordered to leave the harbour, and
did so in great indignation. As his first care was for the approaching
tempest, he did not go far but found safe anchorage in a sheltered and
secluded cove, where his vessels rode the storm with difficulty but
without serious damage. Meanwhile the governor's great fleet had rashly
put out to sea, and was struck with fatal fury by wind and wave. Twenty
or more ships went to the bottom, with Bobadilla, Roldan, and most of
the Admiral's principal enemies, besides all the ill-gotten treasure;
five or six shattered caravels, unable to proceed, found their way back
to San Domingo; of all the fleet, only one ship arrived safe and sound
in Spain, and that, says Ferdinand, was the one that had on board his
father's gold. Truly it was such an instance of poetical justice as one
does not often witness in this world. "We will not inquire now," says
Las Casas, who witnessed the affair, "into this remarkable divine
judgment, for at the last day of the world it will be made quite clear
to us."<a id="footnotetag608" name="footnotetag608"></a><a href="#footnote608" title="Go to footnote 608"><span class="small">[608]</span></a> If such judgments were more often visited upon the right
persons, perhaps the ways of Providence would not have so generally come
to be regarded as inscrutable.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page508" name="page508"></a>(p. 508)</span>

<p>The hurricane was followed by a dead calm, during which the Admiral's
ships were carried by the currents into the <span class="sidenote">Arrival at Cape Honduras.</span>
group of tiny islands called
the Queen's Gardens, on the south side of Cuba. With the first
favourable breeze he took a southwesterly course, in order to strike
that Cochin-Chinese coast farther down toward the Malay peninsula. This
brought him directly to the island of Guanaja and to Cape Honduras,
which he thus reached without approaching the Yucatan channel.<a id="footnotetag609" name="footnotetag609"></a><a href="#footnote609" title="Go to footnote 609"><span class="small">[609]</span></a></p>

<p>Upon the Honduras coast the Admiral found evidences of semi-civilization
with which he was much elated,&mdash;such as copper knives and hatchets,
pottery of skilled and artistic workmanship, and cotton garments finely
woven and beautifully dyed. Here the Spaniards first tasted the
<i>chicha</i>, or maize beer, and marvelled at the heavy clubs, armed with
sharp blades of obsidian, with which the soldiers of Cortes were by and
by to become unpleasantly acquainted. The people here wore cotton
clothes, and, according to Ferdinand, the women covered themselves as
carefully as the Moorish women of Granada.<a id="footnotetag610" name="footnotetag610"></a><a href="#footnote610" title="Go to footnote 610"><span class="small">[610]</span></a> On inquiring as to the
sources of gold and other wealth, the Admiral was now referred to the
west, evidently to Yucatan and Guatemala, or, as he supposed, to the
neighbourhood of the Ganges. Evidently the way to reach these countries
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page509" name="page509"></a>(p. 509)</span> was to keep the land on the starboard and search for the
passage between the Eden continent and the Malay peninsula.<a id="footnotetag611" name="footnotetag611"></a><a href="#footnote611" title="Go to footnote 611"><span class="small">[611]</span></a> This
course at first led Columbus eastward for a greater number of leagues
than he could have relished. Wind and current were dead against him,
too; and when, after forty days of wretched weather,
<span class="sidenote">Cape Gracias a Dios.</span>
he succeeded in
doubling the cape which marks on that coast the end of Honduras and the
beginning of Nicaragua, and found it turning square to the south, it was
doubtless joy at this auspicious change of direction, as well as the
sudden relief from head-winds, that prompted him to name that bold
prominence Cape Gracias a Dios, or Thanks to God.</p>

<span class="sidenote">Columbus shipwrecked.</span>

<p>As the ships proceeded southward in the direction of Veragua, evidences
of the kind of semi-civilization which we recognize as characteristic of
that part of aboriginal America grew more and more numerous. Great
houses were seen, built of "stone and lime," or perhaps of rubble stone
with adobe mortar. Walls were adorned with carvings and pictographs.
<span class="sidenote">The coast of Veragua.</span>
Mummies were found in a good state of preservation. There were signs of
abundant gold; the natives wore plates <span class="pagenum"><a id="page510" name="page510"></a>(p. 510)</span> of it hung by cotton
cords about their necks, and were ready to exchange pieces worth a
hundred ducats for tawdry European trinkets. From these people Columbus
heard what we should call the first "news of the Pacific Ocean," though
it had no such meaning to his mind. From what he heard he understood
that he was on the east side of a peninsula, and that there was another
sea on the other side, by gaining which he might in ten days reach the
mouth of the Ganges.<a id="footnotetag612" name="footnotetag612"></a><a href="#footnote612" title="Go to footnote 612"><span class="small">[612]</span></a> By proceeding on his present course he would
soon come to a "narrow place" between the two seas. There was a curious
equivocation here. No doubt the Indians were honest and correct in what
they tried to tell Columbus. But by the "narrow place" they meant narrow
land, not narrow water; <span class="sidenote">Fruitless search for the Strait of Malacca.</span>
not a strait which connected but an isthmus
which divided the two seas, not the Strait of Malacca, but the Isthmus
of Darien!<a id="footnotetag613" name="footnotetag613"></a><a href="#footnote613" title="Go to footnote 613"><span class="small">[613]</span></a> Columbus, of course, understood them to mean the strait
for which he was looking, and in his excitement at approaching the
long-expected goal he pressed on without waiting to verify the reports
of gold mines in the neighbourhood, a thing that could be done at any
time.<a id="footnotetag614" name="footnotetag614"></a><a href="#footnote614" title="Go to footnote 614"><span class="small">[614]</span></a> By the 5th of December, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page511" name="page511"></a>(p. 511)</span> having reached a
point on the isthmus, a few leagues east of Puerto Bello, without
finding the strait, he yielded to the remonstrances of the crews, and
retraced his course to Veragua. If the strait could not be found, the
next best tidings to carry home to Spain would be the certain
information of the discovery of gold mines, and it was decided to make a
<span class="sidenote">Futile attempt to make a settlement.</span>
settlement here which might serve as a base for future operations. Three
months of misery followed. Many of the party were massacred by the
Indians, the stock of food was nearly exhausted, and the ships were
pierced by worms until it was feared there would be no means left for
going home. Accordingly, it was decided to abandon the enterprise and
return to Hispaniola.<a id="footnotetag615" name="footnotetag615"></a><a href="#footnote615" title="Go to footnote 615"><span class="small">[615]</span></a> In order to allow for the strong westerly
currents in the Caribbean sea, the Admiral first sailed eastward almost
to the gulf of Darien, and then turned to the north. The allowance was
not enough, however. The ships were again carried into the Queen's
Gardens, where they were caught in a storm and nearly beaten to pieces.
At length, on St. John's eve, June 23, 1503, the crazy wrecks&mdash;now full
of water and unable to sail another league&mdash;were beached on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page512" name="page512"></a>(p. 512)</span>
the coast of Jamaica and converted into a sort of rude fortress; and
while two trusty men were sent over to San Domingo in a canoe, to obtain
relief, Columbus and his party remained shipwrecked in Jamaica. They
waited there a whole year before it proved possible to get any relief
from Ovando. He was a slippery knave, who knew how to deal out promises
without taking the first step toward fulfilment.</p>

<p>It was a terrible year that Columbus spent upon the wild coast of
Jamaica. <span class="sidenote">A year of misery.</span>
To all the horrors inseparable from such a situation there was
added the horror of mutiny. The year did not end until there had been a
pitched battle, in which the doughty Bartholomew was, as usual,
victorious. The ringleader was captured, and of the other mutineers such
as were not slain in the fight were humbled and pardoned. At length
Ovando's conduct began to arouse indignation in San Domingo, and was
openly condemned from the pulpit; so that, late in June, 1504, he sent
over to Jamaica a couple of ships which brought away the Admiral and his
starving party. Ovando greeted the brothers Columbus with his customary
hypocritical courtesy, which they well understood. During the past year
the island of Hispaniola had been the scene of atrocities such as have
scarcely been surpassed in history. I shall give a brief account of them
in a future chapter. Columbus was not cheered by what he saw and heard,
and lost no time in starting for Spain. On the 7th of November, 1504,
after a tempestuous voyage and narrow escape from shipwreck, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page513" name="page513"></a>(p. 513)</span>
he landed at San Lucar de Barrameda and made his way to Seville.
<span class="sidenote">Last return to Spain.</span>
Queen
Isabella was then on her death-bed, and breathed her last just nineteen
days later.</p>

<p>The death of the queen deprived Columbus of the only protector who could
stand between him and Fonseca. The reimbursement for the wrongs which he
had suffered at that man's hands was never made. The last eighteen
months of the Admiral's life were spent in sickness and poverty.
Accumulated hardship and disappointment had broken him down, and he died
on <span class="sidenote">Death of Columbus.</span>
Ascension day, May 20, 1506, at Valladolid. So little heed was taken
of his passing away that the local annals of that city, "which give
almost every insignificant event from 1333 to 1539, day by day, do not
mention it."<a id="footnotetag616" name="footnotetag616"></a><a href="#footnote616" title="Go to footnote 616"><span class="small">[616]</span></a> His remains were buried in the Franciscan monastery at
Valladolid, whence they were removed in 1513 to the monastery of Las
Cuevas, at Seville, where the body of his son Diego, second Admiral and
Viceroy of the Indies, was buried in 1526. Ten years after this date,
the bones of father and son were removed to Hispaniola, to the cathedral
of San Domingo; whence they have since been transferred to Havana. The
result of so many removals has been to raise doubts as to whether the
ashes now reposing at Havana are really those of Columbus and his son;
and over this question there has been much critical discussion, of a
sort that we may cheerfully leave to those who like to spend their time
over such trivialities.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page514" name="page514"></a>(p. 514)</span>

<p>There is a tradition that Ferdinand and Isabella, at some date
unspecified, had granted to Columbus, as a legend for his coat-of-arms,
the noble motto:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left30">Á Castilla y á Leon<br>
Nuevo mundo dió Colon,</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>i. e.</i> "To Castile-and-Leon Columbus gave a New World;" and we are
further told that, when the <span class="sidenote">"Nuevo Mundo."</span>
Admiral's bones were removed to Seville,
this motto was, by order of King Ferdinand, inscribed upon his
tomb.<a id="footnotetag617" name="footnotetag617"></a><a href="#footnote617" title="Go to footnote 617"><span class="small">[617]</span></a> This tradition crumbles under the touch of historical
criticism. The Admiral's coat-of-arms, as finally emblazoned under his
own inspection at Seville in 1502, quarters the royal Castle-and-Lion of
the kingdom of Castile with his own devices of five anchors, and a group
of golden islands with a bit of Terra Firma, upon a blue sea. But there
is no legend of any sort, nor is anything of the kind mentioned by Las
Casas or Bernaldez or Peter Martyr. The first allusion to such a motto
is by Oviedo, in 1535, who gives it a somewhat different turn:&mdash;

<p class="left30">Por Castilla y por Leon<br>
Nuevo mundo halló Colon,</p>

<p class="noident"><i>i. e.</i> "For Castile-and-Leon Columbus found a New World." But the other
form is no doubt the better, for Ferdinand Columbus, at some time not
later than 1537, had adopted it, and it may be read to-day upon his tomb
in the cathedral at Seville. The time-honoured tradition has evidently
transferred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page515" name="page515"></a>(p. 515)</span> to the father the legend adopted, if not
originally devised, by his son.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Arms." title="">
</div>

<p>But why is this mere question of heraldry a matter of importance for the
historian? Simply because it furnishes one of the most striking among
many illustrations of the fact that at no time during the life of
Columbus, nor for some years after his death, did anybody use the phrase
"New World" with conscious reference to <i>his</i> discoveries. At the time
of his death their true significance had not yet begun to dawn upon the
mind of any voyager or any writer. It was supposed that he had found a
new route to the Indies by sailing west, and that in the course of this
achievement he had discovered some new islands and a bit or bits of
Terra Firma of more or less doubtful commercial value. To group these
items of discovery into an organic whole, and to ascertain that they
belonged to a whole quite distinct from the Old World, required the work
of many other discoverers, companions and successors to Columbus. In the
following chapter I shall <span class="pagenum"><a id="page516" name="page516"></a>(p. 516)</span> endeavour to show how the conception
of the New World was thus originated and at length became developed into
the form with which we are now familiar.<a href="#toc"><span class="small">[Back to Contents]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 1:</strong> See my <i>Excursions of an Evolutionist</i>, p. 148. A good
succinct account of these various theories, monuments of wasted
ingenuity, is given in Short's <i>North Americans of Antiquity</i>, chap.
iii. The most elaborate statement of the theory of an Israelite
colonization of America is to be found in the ponderous tomes of Lord
Kingsborough, <i>Mexican Antiquities</i>, London, 1831-48, 9 vols.
elephant-folio. Such a theory was entertained by the author of that
curious piece of literary imposture, <i>The Book of Mormon</i>. In this book
we are told that, when the tongues were confounded at Babel, the Lord
selected a certain Jared, with his family and friends, and instructed
them to build eight ships, in which, after a voyage of 344 days, they
were brought to America, where they "did build many mighty cities," and
"prosper exceedingly." But after some centuries they perished because of
their iniquities. In the reign of Zedekiah, when calamity was impending
over Judah, two brothers, Nephi and Laman, under divine guidance led a
colony to America. There, says the veracious chronicler, their
descendants became great nations, and worked in <i>iron</i>, and had stuffs
of <i>silk</i>, besides keeping plenty of <i>oxen</i> and <i>sheep</i>. (<i>Ether</i>, ix.
18, 19; x. 23, 24.) Christ appeared and wrought many wonderful works;
people spake with tongues, and the dead were raised. (3 <i>Nephi</i>, xxvi.
14, 15.) But about the close of the fourth century of our era, a
terrible war between Lamanites and Nephites ended in the destruction of
the latter. Some two million warriors, with their wives and children,
having been slaughtered, the prophet Mormon escaped, with his son
Moroni, to the "hill Cumorah," hard by the "waters of Ripliancum," or
Lake Ontario. (<i>Ether</i>, xv. 2, 8, 11.) There they hid the sacred
tablets, which remained concealed until they were miraculously
discovered and translated by Joseph Smith in 1827. There is, of course,
no element of tradition in this story. It is all pure fiction, and of a
very clumsy sort, such as might easily be devised by an ignorant man
accustomed to the language of the Bible; and of course it was suggested
by the old notion of the Israelitish origin of the red men. The
references are to <i>The Book of Mormon</i>, Salt Lake City: Deseret News

<strong>Footnote 9:</strong> The chipped implements discovered by Messrs. Abbott, Metz,
and Cresson, and by Miss Babbitt, are all on exhibition at the Peabody
Museum in Cambridge, whither it is necessary to go if one would get a
comprehensive view of the relics of interglacial man in North America.
The collection of implements made by Dr. Abbott includes much more than
the palæoliths already referred to. It is one of the most important
collections in the world, and is worth a long journey to see. Containing
more than 20,000 implements, all found within a very limited area in New
Jersey, "as now arranged, the collection exhibits at one and the same
time the sequence of peoples and phases of development in the valley of
the Delaware, from palæolithic man, through the intermediate period, to
the recent Indians, and the relative numerical proportion of the many
forms of their implements, each in its time.... It is doubtful whether
any similar collection exists from which a student can gather so much
information at sight as in this, where the natural pebbles from the
gravel begin the series, and the beautifully chipped points of chert,
jasper, and quartz terminate it in one direction, and the polished celts
and grooved stone axes in the other." There are three principal
groups,&mdash;first, the interglacial palæoliths, secondly, the argillite
points and flakes, and thirdly, the arrow-heads, knives, mortars and
pestles, axes and hoes, ornamental stones, etc., of Indians of the
recent period. Dr. Abbott's <i>Primitive Industry</i>, published in 1881, is
a useful manual for studying this collection; and an account of his
discoveries in the glacial gravels is given in <i>Reports of the Peabody
Museum</i>, vol. ii. pp. 30-48, 225-258; see also vol. iii. p. 492. A
succinct and judicious account of the whole subject is given by H. W.
Haynes, "The Prehistoric Archæology of North America," in Winsor's

<strong>Footnote 11:</strong> In an essay published in 1882 on "Europe before the
Arrival of Man" (<i>Excursions of an Evolutionist</i>, pp. 1-40), I argued
that if we are to find traces of the "missing link," or primordial stock
of primates from which man has been derived, we must undoubtedly look
for it in the Miocene (p. <a href="#page036">36</a>). I am pleased at finding the same opinion
lately expressed by one of the highest living authorities. The case is
thus stated by Alfred Russel Wallace: "The evidence we now possess of
the exact nature of the resemblance of man to the various species of
anthropoid apes, shows us that he has little special affinity for any
one rather than another species, while he differs from them all in
several important characters in which they agree with each other. The
conclusion to be drawn from these facts is, that his points of affinity
connect him with the whole group, while his special peculiarities
equally separate him from the whole group, and that he must, therefore,
have diverged from the common ancestral form before the existing types
of anthropoid apes had diverged from each other. Now this divergence
almost certainly took place as early as the Miocene period, because in
the Upper Miocene deposits of western Europe remains of two species of
ape have been found allied to the gibbons, one of them, dryopithecus,
nearly as large as a man, and believed by M. Lartet to have approached
man in its dentition more than the existing apes. We seem hardly,
therefore, to have reached in the Upper Miocene the epoch of the common
ancestor of man and the anthropoids." (<i>Darwinism</i>, p. 455, London,
1889.) Mr. Wallace goes on to answer the objection of Professor Boyd
Dawkins, "that man did not probably exist in Pliocene times, because
almost all the known mammalia of that epoch are distinct species from
those now living on the earth, and that the same changes of the
environment which led to the modification of other mammalian species
would also have led to a change in man." This argument, at first sight
apparently formidable, quite overlooks the fact that in the evolution of
man there came a point after which variations in his intelligence were
seized upon more and more exclusively by natural selection, to the
comparative neglect of physical variations. After that point man changed
but little in physical characteristics, except in size and complexity of
brain. This is the theorem first propounded by Mr. Wallace in the
<i>Anthropological Review</i>, May, 1864; restated in his <i>Contributions to
Natural Selection</i>, chap. ix., in 1870; and further extended and
developed by me in connection with the theory of man's origin first
suggested in my lectures at Harvard in 1871, and worked out in <i>Cosmic
Philosophy</i>, part ii., chapters xvi., xxi., xxii.<a href="#footnotetag11"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 13:</strong> "There are three human crania in the Museum, which were
found in the gravel at Trenton, one several feet below the surface, the
others near the surface. These skulls, which are of remarkable
uniformity, are of small size and of oval shape, differing from all
other skulls in the Museum. In fact they are of a distinct type, and
hence of the greatest importance. So far as they go they indicate that
palæolithic man was exterminated, or has become lost by admixture with
others during the many thousand years which have passed since he
inhabited the Delaware valley." F. W. Putnam, "The Peabody Museum,"

<strong>Footnote 16:</strong> According to Dr. Rink the Eskimos formerly inhabited the
central portions of North America, and have retreated or been driven
northward; he would make the Eskimos of Siberia an offshoot from those
of America, though he freely admits that there are grounds for
entertaining the opposite view. Dr. Abbott is inclined to attribute an
Eskimo origin to some of the palæoliths of the Trenton gravel. On the
other hand, Mr. Clements Markham derives the American Eskimos from those
of Siberia. It seems to me that these views may be comprehended and
reconciled in a wider one. I would suggest that during the Glacial
period the ancestral Eskimos may have gradually become adapted to arctic
conditions of life; that in the mild interglacial intervals they
migrated northward along with the musk-sheep; and that upon the return
of the cold they migrated southward again, keeping always near the edge
of the ice-sheet. Such a southward migration would naturally enough
bring them in one continent down to the Pyrenees, in the other down to
the Alleghanies; and naturally enough the modern inquirer has his
attention first directed to the indications of their final retreat,
<i>both</i> northward in America and northeastward from Europe through
Siberia. This is like what happened with so many plants and animals.

of Species</i>, chap. xii.</p>

<strong>Footnote 21:</strong> This sort of illustration requires continual limitation
and qualification. The case in ancient America was not <i>quite</i> as it
would have been in Europe if there had been only Aryans there. The
semi-civilized people of the Cordilleras were relatively brachycephalous
as compared with the more barbarous Indians north and east of New
Mexico. It is correct to call this a distinction of race if we mean
thereby a distinction developed upon American soil, a differentiation
within the limits of the red race, and not an intrusion from without. In
this sense the Caribs also may be regarded as a distinct sub-race; and,
in the same sense, we may call the Kafirs a distinct sub-race of African
blacks. See, as to the latter, Tylor, <i>Anthropology</i>,

<strong>Footnote 29:</strong> In the interesting architectural remains unearthed by Dr.
Schliemann at Mycenæ and Tiryns, there have been found at the former
place a few iron keys and knives, at the latter one iron lance-head; but
the form and workmanship of these objects mark them as not older than
the beginning of the fifth century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, or the time of the Persian
wars. With these exceptions the weapons and tools found in these cities,
as also in Troy, were of bronze and stone. Bronze was in common use, but
obsidian knives and arrow-heads of fine workmanship abound in the ruins.
According to Professor Sayce, these ruins must date from 2000 to 1700 <span class="smcap">B.
C.</span> The Greeks of that time would accordingly be placed in the middle
status of barbarism. (See Schliemann's <i>Mycenæ</i>, pp. 75, 364; <i>Tiryns</i>,
p. 171.) In the state of society described in the Homeric poems the
smelting of iron was well known, but the process seems to have been
costly, so that bronze weapons were still commonly used. (Tylor,
<i>Anthropology</i>, p. 279.) The Romans of the regal period were ignorant of
iron. (Lanciani, <i>Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries</i>,
Boston, 1888, pp. 39-48.) The upper period of barbarism was shortened
for Greece and Rome through the circumstance that they learned the
working of iron from Egypt and the use of the alphabet from Ph&oelig;nicia.
Such copying, of course, affects the symmetry of such schemes as Mr.
Morgan's, and allowances have to be made for it. It is curious that both
Greeks and Romans seem to have preserved some tradition of the Bronze
Age:&mdash;</p>

<strong>Footnote 46:</strong> Whether there was ever such a person as Hiawatha is, to
say the least, doubtful. As a traditional culture-hero his attributes

class of sky-gods to which I shall again have occasion to refer. See
Brinton's <i>Myths of the New World</i>, p. 172. When the Indian speaks of
Hiawatha whispering advice to Daganoweda, his meaning is probably the
same as that of the ancient Greek when he attributed the wisdom of some
mortal hero to whispered advice from Zeus or his messenger Hermes.
Longfellow's famous poem is based upon Schoolcraft's book entitled <i>The
Hiawatha Legends</i>, which is really a misnomer, for the book consists
chiefly of Ojibwa stories about Manabozho, son of the West Wind. There
was really no such legend of Hiawatha as that which the poet has

<strong>Footnote 54:</strong> One often hears it said that the cruelty of the Indians
was not greater than that of mediæval Europeans, as exemplified in
judicial torture and in the horrors of the Inquisition. But in such a
judgment there is lack of due discrimination. In the practice of torture
by civil and ecclesiastical tribunals in the Middle Ages, there was a
definite moral purpose which, however lamentably mistaken or perverted,
gave it a very different character from torture wantonly inflicted for
amusement. The atrocities formerly attendant upon the sack of towns, as
e. g. Beziers, Magdeburg, etc., might more properly be regarded as an
illustration of the survival of a spirit fit only for the lowest
barbarism: and the Spanish conquerors of the New World themselves often
exhibited cruelty such as even Indians seldom surpass. See below, vol.
ii. p. 444. In spite of such cases, however, it must be held that for
artistic skill in inflicting the greatest possible intensity of
excruciating pain upon every nerve in the body, the Spaniard was a
bungler and a novice as compared with the Indian. See Dodge's <i>Our Wild
Indians</i>, pp. 536-538. Colonel Dodge was in familiar contact with
Indians for more than thirty years, and writes with fairness and
discrimination.</p>

<p>In truth the question as to comparative cruelty is not so much one of
race as of occupation, except in so far as race is moulded by long
occupation. The "old Adam," i. e. the inheritance from our brute
ancestors, is very strong in the human race. Callousness to the
suffering of others than self is part of this brute-inheritance, and
under the influence of certain habits and occupations this germ of
callousness may be developed to almost any height of devilish cruelty.
In the lower stages of culture the lack of political aggregation on a
large scale is attended with incessant warfare in the shape in which it
comes home to everybody's door. This state of things keeps alive the
passion of revenge and stimulates cruelty to the highest degree. As long
as such a state of things endures, as it did in Europe to a limited
extent throughout the Middle Ages, there is sure to be a dreadful amount
of cruelty. The change in the conditions of modern warfare has been a
very important factor in the rapidly increasing mildness and humanity of
modern times. See my <i>Beginnings of New England</i>, pp. 226-229. Something
more will be said hereafter with reference to the special causes
concerned in the cruelty and brutality of the Spaniards in America.
Meanwhile it may be observed in the present connection, that the Spanish
taskmasters who mutilated and burned their slaves were not
representative types of their own race to anything like the same extent
as the Indians who tortured Brébeuf or Crawford. If the fiendish
Pedrarias was a Spaniard, so too was the saintly Las Casas. The latter
type would be as impossible among barbarians as an Aristotle or a
Beethoven. Indeed, though there are writers who would like to prove the
contrary, it may be doubted whether that type has ever attained to
perfection except under the influence of Christianity.<a href="#footnotetag54"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

connection it may be observed that the name "Mohawk" means "Cannibal."

<strong>Footnote 58:</strong> Until lately our acquaintance with human history was
derived almost exclusively from literary memorials, among which the
Bible, the Homeric poems, and the Vedas, carried us back about as far as
literature could take us. It was natural, therefore, to suppose that the
society of the times of Abraham or Agamemnon was "primitive," and the
wisest scholars reasoned upon such an assumption. With vision thus
restricted to civilized man and his ideas and works, people felt free to
speculate about uncivilized races (generally grouped together
indiscriminately as "savages") according to any <i>à priori</i> whim that
might happen to captivate their fancy. But the discoveries of the last
half-century have opened such stupendous vistas of the past that the age
of Abraham seems but as yesterday. The state of society described in the
book of Genesis had five entire ethnical periods, and the greater part
of a sixth, behind it; and its institutions were, comparatively
speaking, modern.<a href="#footnotetag58"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 64:</strong> The notion of the descent of the human race from a single
"pair," or of different races from different "pairs," is a curious
instance of transferring modern institutions into times primeval. Of
course the idea is absurd. When the elder Agassiz so emphatically
declared that "pines have originated in forests, heaths in heaths,
grasses in prairies, bees in hives, herrings in shoals, buffaloes in
herds, men in nations" (<i>Essay on Classification</i>, London, 1859, p. 58),
he made, indeed, a mistake of the same sort, so far as concerns the
origin of Man, for the nation is a still more modern institution than
the family; but in the other items of his statement he was right, and as
regards the human race he was thinking in the right direction when he
placed <i>multitude</i> instead of <i>duality</i> at the beginning. If instead of
that extremely complex and highly organized multitude called "nation"
(in the plural), he had started with the extremely simple and almost
unorganized multitude called "horde" (in the singular), the statement
for Man would have been correct. Such views were hardly within the reach
of science thirty years ago.<a href="#footnotetag64"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 71:</strong> "There is no embarrassment growing out of problems
respecting the woman's future support, the division of property, or the
adjustment of claims for the possession of the children. The independent
self-support of every adult healthy Indian, male or female, and the
gentile relationship, which is more wide-reaching and authoritative than
that of marriage, have already disposed of these questions, which are
usually so perplexing for the white man. So far as personal maintenance
is concerned, a woman is, as a rule, just as well off without a husband
as with one. What is hers, in the shape of property, remains her own
whether she is married or not. In fact, marriage among these Indians
seems to be but the natural mating of the sexes, to cease at the option
of either of the interested parties." Clay MacCauley, "The Seminole
Indians of Florida", in <i>Fifth Annual Report of the Bureau of

<strong>Footnote 82:</strong> <i>Houses and House-Life</i>, p. 33. At the period of its
greatest power, about 1675, the people of the confederacy were about
25,000 in number. In 1875, according to official statistics (see table
appended to Dodge's <i>Plains of the Great West</i>, pp. 441-448), there were
in the state of New York 198 Oneidas, 203 Onondagas, 165 Cayugas, 3,043
Senecas, and 448 Tuscaroras,&mdash;in all 4,057. Besides these there were
1,279 Oneidas on a reservation in Wisconsin, and 207 Senecas in the
Indian Territory. The Mohawks are not mentioned in the list. During the
Revolutionary War, and just afterward, the Mohawks migrated into Upper
Canada (Ontario), for an account of which the reader may consult the
second volume of Stone's <i>Life of Brant</i>. Portions of the other tribes
also went to Canada. In New York the Oneidas and Tuscaroras were
converted to Christianity by Samuel Kirkland and withheld from alliance
with the British during the Revolution; the others still retain their
ancient religion. They are for the most part farmers and are now

<strong>Footnote 97:</strong> See Bandelier's <i>Archæological Tour in Mexico</i>, Boston,
1885, pp. 160-164. Torquemada's words, cited by Bandelier, are "Quando
entraron los Españoles, dicen que tenia mas de quarenta mil vecinos esta
ciudad." <i>Monarquía Indiana</i>, lib. iii. cap. xix. p. 281. A prolific
source of error is the ambiguity in the word <i>vecinos</i>, which may mean
either "inhabitants" or "householders." Where Torquemada meant 40,000
inhabitants, uncritical writers fond of the marvellous have understood
him to mean 40,000 houses, and multiplying this figure by 5, the average
number of persons <i>in a modern family</i>, have obtained the figure
200,000. But 40,000 houses peopled after the old Mexican fashion, with
at least 200 persons in a house (to put it as low as possible), would
make a city of 8,000,000 inhabitants! Las Casas, in his <i>Destruycion de
las Indias</i>, vii., puts the population of Cholula at about 30,000. I

<strong>Footnote 100:</strong> When Pocahontas visited London in 1616 she was received
at court as befitted a "king's daughter," and the old Virginia
historian, William Stith (born in 1689), says it was a "constant
tradition" in his day that James I. "became jealous, and was highly
offended at Mr. Rolfe for marrying a princess." The notion was that "if
Virginia descended to Pocahontas, as it might do at Powhatan's death, at
her own death the kingdom would be vested in Mr. Rolfe's posterity."
Esten Cooke's <i>Virginia</i>, p. 100. Powhatan (i. e. Wahunsunakok, chief of
the Powhatan tribe) was often called "emperor" by the English settlers.
To their intense bewilderment he told one of them that his office would
descend to his [maternal] brothers, even though he had sons living. It
was thought that this could not be true.<a href="#footnotetag100"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 101:</strong> The small states into which tribes were at first
transformed have in many cases survived to the present time as portions
of great states or nations. The shires or counties of England, which
have been reproduced in the United States, originated in this way, as I
have briefly explained in my little book on <i>Civil Government in the
United States</i>, p. 49. When you look on the map of England, and see the
town of <i>Icklingham</i> in the county of <i>Suffolk</i>, it means that this
place was once the "home" of the "Icklings" or "children of Ickel," a
clan which formed part of the tribe of Angles known as "South folk." So
the names of Gaulish tribes survived as names of French provinces, e. g.
<i>Auvergne</i> from the <i>Arverni</i>, <i>Poitou</i> from the <i>Pictavi</i>, <i>Anjou</i> from
the <i>Andecavi</i>, <i>Béarn</i> from the <i>Bigerrones</i>,

the Senecas, who had the two head war-chiefs, were much the most

<strong>Footnote 111:</strong> The notion of an immense population groaning under the
lash of taskmasters, and building huge palaces for idle despots must be
dismissed. The statements which refer to such a vast population are apt
to be accompanied by incompatible statements. Mr. Morgan is right in
throwing the burden of proof upon those who maintain that a people
without domestic animals or field agriculture could have been so
numerous (<i>Anc. Soc.</i>, p. 195). On the other hand, I believe Mr. Morgan
makes a grave mistake in the opposite direction, in underestimating the
numbers that could be supported upon Indian corn even under a system of
horticulture without the use of the plough. Some pertinent remarks on
the extraordinary reproductive power of maize in Mexico may be found in
Humboldt, <i>Essai politique sur la Nouvelle Espagne</i>, Paris, 1811, tom.
iii. pp. 51-60; the great naturalist is of course speaking of the yield
of maize in ploughed lands, but, after making due allowances, the yield
under the ancient system must have been well-nigh unexampled in barbaric
agriculture.<a href="#footnotetag111"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 120:</strong> Such would naturally result from the desirableness of
securing unity of command. If Demosthenes had been in sole command of
the Athenian armament in the harbour of Syracuse, and had been a
<i>basileus</i>, with priestly authority, who can doubt that some such theory
of the eclipse as that suggested by Philochorus would have been adopted,
and thus one of the world's great tragedies averted? See Grote, <i>Hist.
Greece</i>, vol. vii. chap. lx. M. Fustel de Coulanges, in his admirable
book <i>La Cité antique</i>, pp. 205-210, makes the priestly function of the
king primitive, and the military function secondary; which is entirely

scruples about interfering. The Romans, too, retained part of the king's

<strong>Footnote 133:</strong> The victim, by the offer of which the wrath of the god
was appeased or his favour solicited, must always be some valued
possession of the sacrificer. Hence, e. g., among the Hebrews "wild
animals, as not being property, were generally considered unfit for
sacrifice." (Mackay, <i>op. cit.</i> ii. 398.) Among the Aztecs (Prescott,
<i>loc. cit.</i>) on certain occasions of peculiar solemnity the clan offered
some of its own members, usually children. In the lack of prisoners such
offerings would more often be necessary, hence one powerful incentive to
war. The use of prisoners to buy the god's favour was to some extent a
substitute for the use of the clan's own members, and at a later stage
the use of domestic animals was a further substitution. The legend of
Abraham and Isaac (<i>Genesis</i>, xxii. 1-14) preserves the tradition of
this latter substitution among the ancient Hebrews. Compare the
B&oelig;otian legend of the temple of Dionysos
Aigobolos:&mdash;&#952;&#8059;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961;

Pausanias, ix. 8. A further stage of progress was the substitution of a
mere inanimate symbol for a living victim, whether human or brute, as
shown in the old Roman custom of appeasing "Father Tiber" once a year by
the ceremony of drowning a lot of dolls in that river. Of this
significant rite Mommsen aptly observes, "Die Ideen göttlicher Gnade und
Versöhnbarkeit sind hier ununterscheidbar gemischt mit der frommen
Schlauigkeit, welche es versucht den gefährlichen Herrn durch
scheinhafte Befriedigung zu berücken und abzufinden." <i>Römische
Geschichte</i>, 4<sup>e</sup> Aufl., 1865, Bd. i. p. 176. After reading such a remark
it may seem odd to find the writer, in a footnote, refusing to accept
the true explanation of the custom; but that was a quarter of a century
ago, when much less was known about ancient society than now.<a href="#footnotetag133"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 145:</strong> This writing was at once recognized by learned Spaniards,
like Las Casas, as entirely different from anything found elsewhere in
America. He found in Yucatan "letreros de ciertos caracteres que en otra
ninguna parte," Las Casas, <i>Historia apologética</i>, cap. cxxiii. For an
account of the hieroglyphics, see the learned essays of Dr. Cyrus
Thomas, <i>A Study of the Manuscript Troano</i>, Washington, 1882; "Notes on
certain Maya and Mexican MSS.," <i>Third Report of the Bureau of
Ethnology</i>, pp. 7-153; "Aids to the Study of the Maya Codices," <i>Sixth
Report</i>, pp. 259-371. (The paper last mentioned ends with the weighty
words, "The more I study these characters the stronger becomes the
conviction that they have grown out of a pictographic system similar to
that common among the Indians of North America." Exactly so; and this is
typical of every aspect and every detail of ancient American culture. It
is becoming daily more evident that the old notion of an influence from
Asia has not a leg to stand on.) See also a suggestive paper by the
astronomer, E. S. Holden, "Studies in Central American Picture-Writing,"
<i>First Report of the Bureau of Ethnology</i>, pp. 205-245; Brinton,
<i>Ancient Phonetic Alphabet of Yucatan</i>, New York, 1870; <i>Essays of an
Americanist</i>, Philadelphia, 1890, pp. 193-304; Léon de Rosny, <i>Les
écritures figuratives</i>, Paris, 1870; <i>L'interprétation des anciens
textes Mayas</i>, Paris, 1875; <i>Essai sur le déchiffrement de l'écriture
hiératique de l'Amérique Centrale</i>, Paris, 1876; Förstemann,
<i>Erläuterungen der Maya Handschrift</i>, Dresden, 1886. The decipherment is
as yet but partially accomplished. The Mexican system of writing is
clearly developed from the ordinary Indian pictographs; it could not
have arisen from the Maya system, but the latter might well have been a
further development of the Mexican system; the Maya system had probably
developed some characters with a phonetic value, i. e. was groping
toward the alphabetical stage; but how far this groping had gone must
remain very doubtful until the decipherment has proceeded further. Dr.
Isaac Taylor is too hasty in saying that "the Mayas employed
twenty-seven characters which must be admitted to be alphabetic"
(Taylor, <i>The Alphabet</i>, vol. i. p. 24); this statement is followed by
the conclusion that the Maya system of writing was "superior in
simplicity and convenience to that employed ... by the great Assyrian
nation at the epoch of its greatest power and glory." Dr. Taylor has
been misled by Diego de Landa, whose work (<i>Relation des choses de
l'Yucatan</i>, ed. Brasseur, Paris, 1864) has in it some pitfalls for the
unwary.<a href="#footnotetag145"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 147:</strong> It occurred in the drawings of the artist Fréderic de
Waldeck, who visited Palenque before Stephens, but whose researches were
published later. "His drawings," says Mr. Winsor, "are exquisite; but he
was not free from a tendency to improve and restore, where the
conditions gave a hint, and so as we have them in the final publication
they have not been accepted as wholly trustworthy." <i>Narr. and Crit.
Hist.</i>, i. 194. M. de Charnay puts it more strongly. Upon his drawing of
a certain panel at Palenque, M. de Waldeck "has seen fit to place three
or four elephants. What end did he propose to himself in giving this
fictitious representation? Presumably to give a prehistoric origin to
these ruins, since it is an ascertained fact that elephants in a fossil
state only have been found on the American continent. It is needless to
add that neither Catherwood, who drew these inscriptions most minutely,
nor myself who brought impressions of them away, nor living man, ever
saw these elephants and their fine trunks. But such is the mischief
engendered by preconceived opinions. With some writers it would seem
that to give a recent date to these monuments would deprive them of all
interest. It would have been fortunate had explorers been imbued with
fewer prejudices and gifted with a little more common sense, for then we
should have known the truth with regard to these ruins long since."

<strong>Footnote 148:</strong> Some of his remarks are worth quoting in detail,
especially in view of the time when they were written: "I repeat my
opinion that we are not warranted in going back to any ancient nation of
the Old World for the builders of these cities; that they are not the
work of people who have passed away and whose history is lost, but that
there are strong reasons to believe them the creations of the same races
who inhabited the country at the time of the Spanish conquest, or some
not very distant progenitors. And I would remark that we began our
exploration without any theory to support.... Some are beyond doubt
older than others; some are known to have been inhabited at the time of
the Spanish conquest, and others, perhaps, were really in ruins before;
... but in regard to Uxmal, at least, we believe that it was an existing
and inhabited city at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards."

<strong>Footnote 175:</strong> Just what was then considered wealth, for an individual,
may best be understood by a concrete instance. The historian Snorro
Sturleson, born in 1178, was called a rich man. "In one year, in which
fodder was scarce, he lost 120 head of oxen without being seriously
affected by it." The fortune which he got with his first wife Herdisa,
in 1199, was equivalent nominally to $4,000, or, according to the
standard of to-day, about $80,000. Laing, <i>Heimskringla</i>, vol. i. pp.

<strong>Footnote 176:</strong> Laing's excellent English translation of it was published
in London in 1844. The preliminary dissertation, in five chapters, is of
great value. A new edition, revised by Prof. Rasmus Anderson, was
published in London in 1889. Another charming book is Sir George
Dasent's <i>Story of Burnt Njal</i>, Edinburgh, 1861, 2 vols., translated
from the <i>Njals Saga</i>. Both the saga itself and the translator's learned
introduction give an admirable description of life in Iceland at the end
of the tenth century, the time when the voyages to America were made. It
is a very instructive chapter in history.</p>

<p>The Icelanders of the present day retain the Old Norse language, while
on the Continent it has been modified into Swedish and Norwegian-Danish.
They are a well-educated people, and, in proportion to their numbers,
publish many books.<a href="#footnotetag176"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 177:</strong> A full collection of these chronicles is given in Rafn's
<i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, Copenhagen, 1837, in the original Icelandic,
with Danish and Latin translations. This book is of great value for its
full and careful reproduction of original texts; although the rash
speculations and the want of critical discernment shown in the editor's
efforts to determine the precise situation of Vinland have done much to
discredit the whole subject in the eyes of many scholars. That is,
however, very apt to be the case with first attempts, like Rafn's, and
the obvious defects of his work should not be allowed to blind us to its
merits. In the footnotes to the present chapter I shall cite it simply
as "Rafn;" as the exact phraseology is often important, I shall usually
cite the original Icelandic, and (for the benefit of readers unfamiliar
with that language) shall also give the Latin version, which has been
well made, and quite happily reflects the fresh and pithy vigour of the
original. An English translation of all the essential parts may be found
in De Costa, <i>Pre-Columbian Discovery of America by the Northmen</i>, 2d
ed., Albany, 1890; see also Slafter, <i>Voyages of the Northmen to
America</i>, Boston, 1877 (Prince Society). An Icelandic version,
interpolated in Peringskiold's edition of the <i>Heimskringla</i>, 1697, is
translated in Laing, vol. iii. pp. 344-361.</p>

<p>The first modern writer to call attention to the Icelandic voyages to
Greenland and Vinland was Arngrim Jónsson, in his <i>Crymog&oelig;a</i>,
Hamburg, 1610, and more explicitly in his <i>Specimen Islandiæ
historicum</i>, Amsterdam, 1643. The voyages are also mentioned by
Campanius, in his <i>Kort beskrifning om provincien Nya Swerige uti
America</i>, Stockholm, 1702. The first, however, to bring the subject
prominently before European readers was that judicious scholar Thormodus
Torfæus, in his two books <i>Historia Vinlandiæ antiquæ</i>, and <i>Historia
Gronlandiæ antiquæ</i>, Copenhagen, 1705 and 1706. Later writers have until
very recently added but little that is important to the work of Torfæus.
In the voluminous literature of the subject the discussions chiefly
worthy of mention are Forster's <i>Geschichte der Entdeckungen und
Schiffahrten im Norden</i>, Frankfort, 1784, pp. 44-88; and Humboldt,
<i>Examen critique</i>, etc., Paris, 1837, tom. i. pp. 84-104; see, also,
Major, <i>Select Letters of Columbus</i>, London, 1847 (Hakluyt Soc.) pp.
xii.-xxi. The fifth chapter of Samuel Laing's preliminary dissertation
to the <i>Heimskringla</i>, which is devoted to this subject, is full of good
sense; for the most part the shrewd Orkneyman gets at the core of the
thing, though now and then a little closer knowledge of America would
have been useful to him. The latest critical discussion of the sources,
marking a very decided advance since Rafn's time, is the paper by Gustav
Storm, professor of history in the University of Christiania, "Studier
over Vinlandsreiserne," in <i>Aarbøger for Nordisk Oldkyndighed og
Historie</i>, Copenhagen, 1887, pp. 293-372.</p>

<p>Since this chapter was written I have seen an English translation of the
valuable paper just mentioned, "Studies on the Vineland Voyages," in
<i>Mémoires de la société royale des antiquaires du Nord</i>, Copenhagen,
1888, pp. 307-370. I have therefore in most cases altered my footnote
references below, making the page-numbers refer to the English version
(in which, by the way, some parts of the Norwegian original are, for no
very obvious reason, omitted). By an odd coincidence there comes to me
at the same time a book fresh from the press, whose rare beauty of
mechanical workmanship is fully equalled by its intrinsic merit, <i>The
Finding of Wineland the Good&mdash;the History of the Icelandic Discovery of
America</i>, edited and translated from the earliest records by Arthur
Middleton Reeves, London, 1890. This beautiful quarto contains phototype
plates of the original Icelandic vellums in the <i>Hauks-bók</i>, the MS. AM.
557, and the <i>Flateyar-bók</i>, together with the texts carefully edited,
an admirable English translation, and several chapters of critical
discussion decidedly better than anything that has gone before it. On
reading it carefully through, it seems to me the best book we have on
the subject in English, or perhaps in any language.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, the news has come of the sudden and
dreadful death of Mr. Reeves, in the railroad disaster at Hagerstown,
Indiana, February 25, 1891. Mr. Reeves was an American scholar of most
brilliant promise, only in his thirty-fifth year.<a href="#footnotetag177"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 179:</strong> We thus see the treacherousness of one of the arguments
cited by the illustrious Arago to prove that the Greenland coast must be
colder now than in the tenth century. The Icelanders, he thinks, called
it "a green land" because of its verdure, and therefore it must have
been warmer than at present. But the land which Eric called green was
evidently nothing more than the region about Julianeshaab, which still
has plenty of verdure; and so the argument falls to the ground. See
Arago, <i>Sur l'état thermométrique du globe terrestre</i>, in his
<i>&OElig;uvres</i>, tom. v. p. 243. There are reasons, however, for believing
that Greenland was warmer in the tenth century than at present. See

<strong>Footnote 180:</strong> The map is reduced from Rafn's <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>,
tab. xv. The ruins dotted here and there upon it have been known ever
since the last rediscovery of Greenland in 1721, but until after 1831
they were generally supposed to be the ruins of the West Bygd. After the
fifteenth century, when the old colony had perished, and its existence
had become a mere literary tradition, there grew up a notion that the
names East Bygd and West Bygd indicated that the two settlements must
have been respectively eastward and westward of Cape Farewell; and after
1721 much time was wasted in looking for vestiges of human habitations
on the barren and ice-bound eastern coast. At length, in 1828-31, the
exploring expedition sent out by the Danish government, under the very
able and intelligent Captain Graah, demonstrated that both settlements
were west of Cape Farewell, and that the ruins here indicated upon the
map are the ruins of the East Bygd. It now became apparent that a
certain description of Greenland by Ivar Bardsen&mdash;written in Greenland
in the fourteenth century, and generally accessible to European scholars
since the end of the sixteenth, but not held in much esteem before
Captain Graah's expedition&mdash;was quite accurate and extremely valuable.
From Bardsen's description, about which we shall have more to say
hereafter, we can point out upon the map the ancient sites with much
confidence. Of those mentioned in the present work, the bishop's church,
or "cathedral" (a view of which is given below, p. <a href="#page222">222</a>), was at
Kakortok. The village of Gardar, which gave its name to the bishopric,
was at Kaksiarsuk, at the northeastern extremity of Igaliko fiord.
Opposite Kaksiarsuk, on the western fork of the fiord, the reader will
observe a ruined church; that marks the site of Brattahlid. The fiord of
Igaliko was called by the Northmen Einarsfiord; and that of
Tunnudliorbik was their Ericsfiord. The monastery of St. Olaus, visited
by Nicolò Zeno (see below, p. <a href="#page240">240</a>), is supposed by Mr. Major to have
been situated near the Iisblink at the bottom of Tessermiut fiord,
between the east shore of the fiord and the small lake indicated on the
map.<a href="#footnotetag180"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 183:</strong> The year seems to have been that in which Christianity
was definitely established by law in Iceland, viz., <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1000. The
chronicle <i>Thattr Eireks Raudha</i> is careful about verifying its dates by
checking one against another. See Rafn, p. 15. The most masterly work on
the conversion of the Scandinavian people is Maurer's <i>Die Bekehrung des
Norwegischen Stammes zum Christenthume</i>, Munich, 1855; for an account of
the missionary work in Iceland and Greenland, see vol. i. pp. 191-242,

<p><a id="footnote184" name="footnote184"></a>
<strong>Footnote 184:</strong> The name means "Turk," and has served as a touchstone for
the dullness of commentators. To the Northmen a "Southman" would
naturally be a German, and why should a German be called a Turk? or how
should these Northmen happen to have had a Turk in their company? Mr.
Laing suggests that he may have been a Magyar. Yes; or he may have
visited the Eastern Empire and taken part in a fight <i>against</i> Turks,
and so have got a soubriquet, just as Thorhall Gamlason, after returning
from Vinland to Iceland, was ever afterward known as "the Vinlander."
That did not mean that he was an American redskin. See below, p. <a href="#page203">203</a>.
From Tyrker's grimaces one commentator sagely infers that he had been
eating grapes and got drunk; and another (even Mr. Laing!) thinks it
necessary to remind us that all the grape-juice in Vinland would not
fuddle a man unless it had been fermented,&mdash;and then goes on to ascribe
the absurdity to our innocent chronicle, instead of the stupid
annotator. See <i>Heimskringla</i>, vol. i.

Good." In the course of the winter following Leif's return his father

their ships would be needed for so large a company; and besides Thorfinn
himself, three other captains are mentioned,&mdash;Snorro Thorbrandsson,
Bjarni Grimolfsson, and Thorhall Gamlason. The narrative gives a
picturesque account of this Thorhall, who was a pagan and fond of
deriding his comrades for their belief in the new-fangled Christian
notions. He seems to have left his comrades and returned to Europe
before they had abandoned their enterprise. A further reference to him

<strong>Footnote 190:</strong> The fate of Bjarni was pathetic and noble. It was decided
that as many as possible should save themselves in the stern boat. "Then
Bjarni ordered that the men should go in the boat by lot, and not
according to rank. As it would not hold all, they accepted the saying,
and when the lots were drawn, the men went out of the ship into the
boat. The lot was that Bjarni should go down from the ship to the boat
with one half of the men. Then those to whom the lot fell went down from
the ship to the boat. When they had come into the boat, a young
Icelander, who was the companion of Bjarni, said: 'Now thus do you
intend to leave me, Bjarni?' Bjarni replied, 'That now seems necessary.'
He replied with these words: 'Thou art not true to the promise made when
I left my father's house in Iceland.' Bjarni replied: 'In this thing I
do not see any other way'; continuing, 'What course can you suggest?' He
said: 'I see this, that we change places and thou come up here and I go
down there.' Bjarni replied: 'Let it be so, since I see that you are so
anxious to live, and are frightened by the prospect of death.' Then they
changed places, and he descended into the boat with the men, and Bjarni
went up into the ship. It is related that Bjarni and the sailors with
him in the ship perished in the worm sea. Those who went in the boat
went on their course until they came to land, where they told all these
things." De Costa's version from <i>Saga Thorfinns Karlsefnis</i>, Rafn, pp.

simple. For example, a warm early spring on the coast of Greenland
increases the discharge of icebergs from its fiords to wander down the
Atlantic ocean; and this increase of floating ice tends to chill and
dampen the summers at least as far South as Long Island, if not
farther.<a href="#footnotetag198"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

classed as Middle English, but may still be heard in the north of

on holy days" (<i>Century Dict.</i> s.v.); or possibly from a pagan
superstition that water abounding in flat fishes is especially safe for
mariners (Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> ix. 70); or possibly from some lost

<strong>Footnote 216:</strong> A favourite method of determining the exact spots visited
by the Northmen has been to compare their statements regarding the shape

well-known points on the New England coast. It is a tempting method, but
unfortunately treacherous, because the same general description will
often apply well enough to several different places. It is like summer
boarders in the country struggling to tell one another where they have
been to drive,&mdash;past a school-house, down a steep hill, through some

<strong>Footnote 217:</strong> It is not meant that stone implements did not continue to
be used in some parts of Europe far into the Middle Ages. But this was
not because iron was not perfectly well known, but because in many
backward regions it was difficult to obtain or to work, so that stone
continued in use. As my friend, Mr. T. S. Perry, reminds me, Helbig says
that stone-pointed spears were used by some of the English at the battle
of Hastings, and stone battle-axes by some of the Scots under William
Wallace at the end of the thirteenth century. <i>Die Italiker in der

<strong>Footnote 218:</strong> My use of the word "inventing" is, in this connection, a
slip of the pen. Of course the tales of "men whose heads do grow beneath
their shoulders," the Sciopedæ, etc., as told by Sir John Mandeville,
were not invented by the mediæval imagination, but copied from ancient
authors. They may be found in Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i>, lib. vii., and were
mentioned before his time by Ktesias, as well as by Hecatæus, according
to Stephanus of Byzantium. Cf. Aristophanes, <i>Aves</i>, 1553; Julius
Solinus, <i>Polyhistor</i>, ed. Salmasius, cap. 240. Just as these sheets are
going to press there comes to me Mr. Perry's acute and learned <i>History
of Greek Literature</i>, New York, 1890, in which this subject is mentioned
in connection with the mendacious and medical Ktesias:&mdash;These stories
have probably acquired a literary currency "by exercise of the habit,
not unknown even to students of science, of indiscriminate copying from
one's predecessors, so that in reading Mandeville we have the ghosts of
the lies of Ktesias, almost sanctified by the authority of Pliny, who
quoted them and thereby made them a part of mediæval folk-lore&mdash;and from
folk-lore, probably, they took their remote start"

<strong>Footnote 221:</strong> Much curious information respecting the use of elephants
in war may be found in the learned work of the Chevalier Armandi,
<i>Histoire militaire des éléphants</i>, Paris, 1843. As regards Thorfinn's
bull, Mr. Laing makes the kind of blunder that our British cousins are
sometimes known to make when they get the Rocky Mountains within sight
of Bunker Hill monument. "A continental people in that part of America,"
says Mr. Laing, "could not be strangers to the much more formidable
bison." <i>Heimskringla</i>, p. 169. Bisons on the Atlantic coast, Mr.
Laing?! And then his comparison quite misses the point; a bison, if the
natives had been familiar with him, would not have been at all
formidable as compared to the bull which they had never before seen. A
horse is much less formidable than a cougar, but Aztec warriors who did
not mind a cougar were paralyzed with terror at the sight of men on
horseback. It is the unknown that frightens in such cases. Thorfinn's
natives were probably familiar with such large animals as moose and
deer, but a deer isn't a bull.<a href="#footnotetag221"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 233:</strong> Here the narrator seems determined to give us a genuine
smack of the marvellous, for when the fleeing uniped comes to a place
where his retreat seems cut off by an arm of the sea, he runs (glides,
or hops?) across the water without sinking. In Vigfusson's version,
however, the marvellous is eliminated, and the creature simply runs over
the stubble and disappears. The incident is evidently an instance where
the narrative has been "embellished" by introducing a feature from
ancient classical writers. The "Monocoli," or one-legged people, are
mentioned by Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i>, vii. 2: "Item hominum genus qui

<strong>Footnote 252:</strong> Indeed, the parallel existence of the Flateyar-bók
version of Eric the Red's Saga, alongside of the Hauks-bók version, is
pretty good proof of the existence of a written account older than
Hauk's time. The discrepancies between the two versions are such as to
show that Jón Thordharson did not copy from Hauk, but followed some
other version not now forthcoming. Jón mentions six voyages in
connection with Vinland: 1. Bjarni Herjulfsson; 2. Leif; 3. Thorvald; 4.
Thorstein and Gudrid; 5. Thorfinn Karlsefni; 6. Freydis. Hauk, on the
other hand, mentions only the two principal voyages, those of Leif and
Thorfinn; ignoring Bjarni, he accredits his adventures to Leif on his
return voyage from Norway in 999, and he makes Thorvald a comrade of
Thorfinn, and mixes his adventures with the events of Thorfinn's voyage.
Dr. Storm considers Hauk's account intrinsically the more probable, and
thinks that in the Flateyar-bók we have a later amplification of the
tradition. But while I agree with Dr. Storm as to the general
superiority of the Hauk version, I am not convinced by his arguments on
this point. It seems to me likely that the Flateyar-bók here preserves
more faithfully the details of an older tradition too summarily
epitomized in the Hauks-bók. As the point in no way affects the general
conclusions of the present chapter, it is hardly worth arguing here. The
main thing for us is that the divergencies between the two versions,
when coupled with their agreement in the most important features,
indicate that both writers were working upon the basis of an antecedent
written tradition, like the authors of the first and third synoptic
gospels. Only here, of course, there are in the divergencies no symptoms
of what the Tübingen school would call "<i>tendenz</i>," impairing and
obscuring to an indeterminate extent the general trustworthiness of the
narratives. On the whole, it is pretty clear that Hauks-bók and
Flateyar-bók were independent of each other, and collated, each in its
own way, earlier documents that have probably since
perished.<a href="#footnotetag252"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 253:</strong> It is further interesting as the only undoubted reference
to Vinland in a mediæval book written beyond the limits of the
Scandinavian world. There is also, however, a passage in Ordericus
Vitalis (<i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i>, iv. 29), in which <i>Finland</i> and the
Orkneys, along with Greenland and Iceland, are loosely described as
forming part of the dominions of the kings of Norway. This Finland does
not appear to refer to the country of the Finns, east of the Baltic, and
it has been supposed that it may have been meant for Vinland. The book
of Ordericus was written about 1140.<a href="#footnotetag253"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

such voyage is known to have been undertaken by Harold of Norway, nor is
it likely. Adam was probably thinking of an Arctic voyage undertaken by
one Thorir under the auspices of King Harold; one of the company brought
back a polar bear and gave it to King Swend, who was much pleased with
it. See Rafn, 339. "Regionam" and "ferentes" in the above extract are

<strong>Footnote 258:</strong> See <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, chap. xi. I am indebted to Mr.
Tillinghast, of Harvard University Library, for calling my attention to
a letter from Rev. John Lathrop, of Boston, to Hon. John Davis, August
10, 1809, containing George Washington's opinion of the Dighton
inscription. When President Washington visited Cambridge in the fall of
1789, he was shown about the college buildings by the president and
fellows of the university. While in the museum he was observed to "fix
his eye" upon a full-size copy of the Dighton inscription made by the
librarian, James Winthrop. Dr. Lathrop, who happened to be standing near
Washington, "ventured to give the opinion which several learned men had
entertained with respect to the origin of the inscription." Inasmuch as
some of the characters were thought to resemble "oriental" characters,
and inasmuch as the ancient Ph&oelig;nicians had sailed outside of the
Pillars of Hercules, it was "conjectured" that some Ph&oelig;nician vessels
had sailed into Narragansett bay and up the Taunton river. "While
detained by winds, or other causes now unknown, the people, it has been
conjectured, made the inscription, now to be seen on the face of the
rock, and which we may suppose to be a record of their fortunes or of
their fate."</p>

<p>"After I had given the above account, the President smiled and said he
believed the learned gentlemen whom I had mentioned were mistaken; and
added that in the younger part of his life his business called him to be
very much in the wilderness of Virginia, which gave him an opportunity
to become acquainted with many of the customs and practices of the
Indians. The Indians, he said, had a way of writing and recording their
transactions, either in war or hunting. When they wished to make any
such record, or leave an account of their exploits to any who might come
after them, they scraped off the outer bark of a tree, and with a
vegetable ink, or a little paint which they carried with them, on the
smooth surface they wrote in a way that was generally understood by the
people of their respective tribes. As he had so often examined the rude
way of writing practised by the Indians of Virginia, and observed many
of the characters on the inscription then before him so nearly resembled
the characters used by the Indians, he had no doubt the inscription was
made long ago by some natives of America." <i>Proceedings of Massachusetts
Historical Society</i>, vol. x. p. 115. This pleasant anecdote shows in a
new light Washington's accuracy of observation and unfailing
common-sense. Such inscriptions have been found by the thousand,
scattered over all parts of the United States; for a learned study of
them see Garrick Mallery, "Pictographs of the North American Indians,"
<i>Reports of Bureau of Ethnology</i>, iv. 13-256. "The voluminous discussion
upon the Dighton rock inscription," says Colonel Mallery, "renders it
impossible wholly to neglect it.... It is merely a type of Algonquin
rock-carving, not so interesting as many others.... It is of purely
Indian origin, and is executed in the peculiar symbolic character of the
Kekeewin," p. 20. The characters observed by Washington in the Virginia
forests would very probably have been of the same type. Judge Davis, to
whom Dr. Lathrop's letter was addressed, published in 1809 a paper
maintaining the Indian origin of the Dighton inscription.</p>

<p>A popular error, once started on its career, is as hard to kill as a
cat. Otherwise it would be surprising to find, in so meritorious a book
as Oscar Peschel's <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>,
Stuttgart, 1877, p. 82, an unsuspecting reliance upon Rafn's ridiculous
interpretation of this Algonquin pictograph. In an American writer as
well equipped as Peschel, this particular kind of blunder would of
course be impossible; and one is reminded of Humboldt's remark, "Il est
des recherches qui ne peuvent s'exécuter que près des sources mêmes."
<i>Examen critique</i>, etc., tom. ii. p. 102.</p>

<p>In old times, I may add, such vagaries were usually saddled upon the
Ph&oelig;nicians, until since Rafn's time the Northmen have taken their
place as the pack-horses for all sorts of antiquarian
"conjecture."<a href="#footnotetag258"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 267:</strong> The views of Professor Horsford as to the geographical
situation of Vinland and its supposed colonization by Northmen are set
forth in his four monographs, <i>Discovery of America by Northmen&mdash;address
at the unveiling of the statue of Leif Eriksen</i>, etc., Boston, 1888;
<i>The Problem of the Northmen</i>, Cambridge, 1889; <i>The Discovery of the
Ancient City of Norumbega</i>, Boston, 1890; <i>The Defences of Norumbega</i>,
Boston, 1891. Among Professor Horsford's conclusions the two principal
are: 1. that the "river flowing through a lake into the sea" (Rafn, p.
147) is Charles river, and that Leif's booths were erected near the site
of the present Cambridge hospital; 2. that "Norumbega"&mdash;a word loosely
applied by some early explorers to some region or regions somewhere
between the New Jersey coast and the Bay of Fundy&mdash;was the Indian
utterance of "Norbega" or "Norway;" and that certain stone walls and
dams at and near Watertown are vestiges of an ancient "city of
Norumbega," which was founded and peopled by Northmen and carried on a
more or less extensive trade with Europe for more than three centuries.</p>

<p>With regard to the first of these conclusions, it is perhaps as likely
that Leif's booths were within the present limits of Cambridge as in any
of the numerous places which different writers have confidently assigned
for them, all the way from Point Judith to Cape Breton. A judicious
scholar will object not so much to the conclusion as to the character of
the arguments by which it is reached. Too much weight is attached to
hypothetical etymologies.</p>

<p>With regard to the Norse colony alleged to have flourished for three
centuries, it is pertinent to ask, what became of its cattle and horses?
Why do we find no vestiges of the burial-places of these Europeans? or
of iron tools and weapons of mediæval workmanship? Why is there no
documentary mention, in Scandinavia or elsewhere in Europe, of this
transatlantic trade? etc., etc. Until such points as these are disposed
of, any further consideration of the hypothesis may properly be
postponed.<a href="#footnotetag267"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 272:</strong> Reeves, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 83. In another vellum it is
mentioned that in 1347 "a ship came from Greenland, which had sailed to
Markland, and there were eighteen men on board." As Mr. Reeves well
observes: "The nature of the information indicates that the knowledge of
the discovery had not altogether faded from the memories of the
Icelanders settled in Greenland. It seems further to lend a measure of
plausibility to a theory that people from the Greenland colony may from
time to time have visited the coast to the southwest of their home for
supplies of wood, or for some kindred purpose. The visitors in this case
had evidently intended to return directly from Markland to Greenland,
and had they not been driven out of their course to Iceland, the
probability is that this voyage would never have found mention in
Icelandic chronicles, and all knowledge of it must have vanished as
completely as did the colony to which the Markland visitors
belonged."<a href="#footnotetag272"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

but evidently one <span class="smcap">X</span> has been omitted, for it should be 1390, and is
correctly so given by Marco Barbaro, in his <i>Genealogie dei nobili
Veneti</i>; of Antonio Zeno he says, "Scrisse con il fratello Nicolò Kav.
li viaggi dell' Isole sotto il polo artico, e di quei scoprimente del
1390, e che per ordine di Zieno, re di Frislanda, si portò nel
continente d'Estotilanda nell' America settentrionale e che si fermò 14
anni in Frislanda, cioè 4 con suo fratello Nicolò e 10 solo." (This
valuable work has never been published. The original MS., in Barbaro's
own handwriting, is preserved in the Biblioteca di San Marco at Venice.
There is a seventeenth century copy of it among the Egerton MSS. in the
British Museum.)&mdash;Nicolò did not leave Italy until after December 14,
1388 (Muratori, <i>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</i>, tom. xxii. p. 779). The
map can hardly have been made before Antonio's voyage, about 1400. The
places on the map are wildly out of position, as was common enough in
old maps. Greenland is attached to Norway according to the general
belief in the Middle Ages. In his confusion between the names "Estland"
and "Islanda," young Nicolò has tried to reproduce the Shetland group,
or something like it, and attach it to Iceland. "Icaria," probably
Kerry, in Ireland, has been made into an island and carried far out into
the Atlantic. The queerest of young Nicolò's mistakes was in placing the
monastery of St. Olaus ("St. Thomas"). He should have placed it on the
southwest coast of Greenland, near his "Af [p-]montor;"
but he has got it on the extreme northeast, just about
where Greenland is joined to Europe.<a href="#footnotetag283"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

Walsingham had reference to the projected voyage of Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, which was made in 1583. Ingram's relation, "w<sup>ch</sup> he reported

&#7952;&#947;&#8061;&mdash;"I, the sinner and wretch, open my stammering,
stuttering lips," etc.&mdash;The book has been the occasion of some
injudicious excitement within the last half century. Cosmas gave a
description of some comparatively recent inscriptions on the peninsula
of Sinai, and because he could not find anybody able to read them, he
inferred that they must be records of the Israelites on their passage
through the desert. (Compare the Dighton rock, above, p. <a href="#page214">214</a>.) Whether
in the sixth century of grace or in the nineteenth, your unregenerate
and unchastened antiquary snaps at conclusions as a drowsy dog does at
flies. Some years ago an English clergyman, Charles Forster, started up
the nonsense again, and argued that these inscriptions might afford a
clue to man's primeval speech! Cf. Bunsen, <i>Christianity and Mankind</i>,

<strong>Footnote 317:</strong> Such views have their advocates even now. There still
lives, I believe, in England, a certain John Hampden, who with dauntless
breast maintains that the earth is a circular plane with centre at the
north pole and a circumference of nearly 30,000 miles where poor
misguided astronomers suppose the south pole to be. The sun moves across
the sky at a distance of about 800 miles. From the boundless abyss
beyond the southern circumference, with its barrier of icy mountains,
came the waters which drowned the antediluvian world; for, as this
author quite reasonably observes, "on a globular earth such a deluge
would have been physically Impossible." Hampden's title is somewhat like
that of Cosmas,&mdash;<i>The New Manual of Biblical Cosmography</i>, London, 1877;
and he began in 1876 to publish a periodical called <i>The Truth-Seeker's
Oracle and Scriptural Science Review</i>. Similar views have been set forth
by one Samuel Rowbotham, under the pseudonym of "Parallax," <i>Zetetic
Astronomy. Earth not a Globe. An experimental inquiry into the true
figure of the earth, proving it a plane without orbital or axial
motion</i>, etc., London, 1873; and by a William Carpenter, <i>One Hundred
Proofs that the Earth is not a Globe</i>, Baltimore, 1885. There is a very
considerable quantity of such literature afloat, the product of a kind
of mental aberration that thrives upon paradox. When I was
superintendent of the catalogue of Harvard University library, I made
the class "Eccentric Literature" under which to group such books,&mdash;the
lucubrations of circle-squarers, angle-trisectors, inventors of
perpetual motion, devisers of recipes for living forever without dying,
crazy interpreters of Daniel and the Apocalypse, upsetters of the
undulatory theory of light, the Bacon-Shakespeare lunatics, etc.; a
dismal procession of long-eared bipeds, with very raucous bray. The late
Professor De Morgan devoted a bulky and instructive volume to an account
of such people and their crotchets. See his <i>Budget of Paradoxes</i>,

<strong>Footnote 322:</strong> They were taken from Chios in the fourth century by the

disastrous" is ably set forth by Mr. Pears, <i>The Fall of

thither as it was, all the way from the upper Nile to the Thian-Shan
mountains, we can easily understand this if we remember how an ignorant
mind conceives all points distant from its own position as near to one
another; i. e. if you are about to start from New York for Arizona, your
housemaid will perhaps ask you to deliver a message to her brother in
Manitoba. Nowhere more than in the history of geography do we need to

<strong>Footnote 334:</strong> These Arimaspians afford an interesting example of the
uncritical statements of travellers at an early time, as well as of
their tenacious vitality. The first mention of these mythical people
seems to have been made by Greek travellers in Scythia as early as the
seventh century before Christ; and they furnished Aristeas of
Proconnesus, somewhat later, with the theme of his poem "Arimaspeia,"
which has perished, all except six verses quoted by Longinus. See Mure's
<i>Literature of Antient Greece</i>, vol. iv. p. 68. Thence the notion of the
Arimaspians seems to have passed to Herodotus (iii. 116; iv. 27) and to
Æschylus:&mdash;</p>

<strong>Footnote 335:</strong> Odoric mentions Juggernaut processions and the burning of
widows; in Sumatra he observed cannibalism and community of wives; he
found the kingdom of Prester John in Chinese Tartary; "but as regards
him," says wise Odoric, "not one hundredth part is true of what is told
of him as if it were undeniable." Yule's <i>Cathay</i>, vol. i. pp. 79, 85,

<strong>Footnote 336:</strong> Colonel Yule gives a list of fourteen important passages
taken bodily from Odoric by Mandeville. <i>Op. cit.</i> i. 28. It is very
doubtful if that famous book, "Sir John Mandeville's Travels," was
written by a Mandeville, or by a knight, or even by an Englishman. It
seems to have been originally written in French by Jean de Bourgogne, a
physician who lived for some years at Liège, and died there somewhere
about 1370. He may possibly have been an Englishman named John Burgoyne,
who was obliged some years before that date to flee his country for
homicide or for some political offence. He had travelled as far as Egypt
and Palestine, but no farther. His book is almost entirely cribbed from
others, among which may be mentioned the works of Jacques de Vitry,
Plano Carpini, Hayton the Armenian, Boldensele's Itinerary, Albert of
Aix's chronicle of the first crusade, Brunetto Latini's <i>Trésor</i>, Petrus
Comestor's <i>Historia scholastica</i>, the <i>Speculum</i> of Vincent de
Beauvais, etc., etc. It is one of the most wholesale and successful
instances of plagiarism and imposture on record. See <i>The Buke of John
Mandevill, from the unique copy (Egerton MS. 1982) in the British
Museum. Edited by G. F. Warner.</i> Westminster, 1889.

<strong>Footnote 337:</strong> One piece of Pegolotti's advice is still useful for
travellers in the nineteenth century who visit benighted heathen
countries afflicted with robber tariffs: "And don't forget that if you
treat the custom-house officers with respect, and make them something of
a present in goods or money, they will behave with great civility and
always be ready to appraise your wares below their real value." <i>Op.

<strong>Footnote 338:</strong> The works of all the writers mentioned in this paragraph,
or copious extracts from them, may be found in Yule's <i>Cathay</i>, which
comprises also the book of the celebrated Ibn Batuta, of Tangier, whose
travels, between 1325 and 1355, covered pretty much the whole of Asia
except Siberia, besides a journey across Sahara to the river Niger. His
book does not seem to have attracted attention in Europe until early in
the present century.<a href="#footnotetag338"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 348:</strong> The story is discredited by Mannert, <i>Geographie der
Griechen und Römer</i>, bd. i. pp. 19-26; Gossellin, <i>Recherches sur la
géographie des Anciens</i>, tom. i. p. 149; Lewis, <i>Astronomy of the

defended by Heeren, <i>Ideen über die Politik, den Verkehr</i>, etc., 3e
aufl., Göttingen, 1815, bd. i. abth. ii. pp. 87-93; Rennell, <i>Geography
of Herodotus</i>, pp. 672-714; Grote, <i>History of Greece</i>, vol. iii. pp.
377-385. The case is ably presented in Bunbury's <i>History of Ancient
Geography</i>, vol. i. pp. 289-296, where it is concluded that the story
"cannot be disproved or pronounced to be absolutely impossible; but the
difficulties and improbabilities attending it are so great that they
cannot reasonably be set aside without better evidence than the mere
statement of Herodotus, upon the authority of unknown informants." Mr.
Bunbury (vol. i. p. 317) says that he has reasons for believing that Mr.
Grote afterwards changed his opinion and came to agree with Sir George
Lewis.<a href="#footnotetag348"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 349:</strong> In reading the learned works of Sir George Cornewall
Lewis, one is often reminded of what Sainte-Beuve somewhere says of the
great scholar Letronne, when he had spent the hour of his lecture in
demolishing some pretty or popular belief: "Il se frotta les mains et
s'en alla bien content." When it came to ancient history, Sir George was
undeniably fond of "the everlasting No." In the present case his
skepticism seems on the whole well-judged, but some of his arguments
savour of undue haste toward a negative conclusion. He thus strangely
forgets that what we call autumn is springtime in the southern
hemisphere (<i>Astronomy of the Ancients</i>, p. 511). His argument that the
time alleged was insufficient for the voyage is fully met by Major
Rennell, who has shown that the time was amply sufficient, and that the
direction of winds and ocean currents would make the voyage around
southern Africa from east to west much easier than from west to
east.<a href="#footnotetag349"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 368:</strong> Another notion, less easily explicable and less commonly
entertained, but interesting for its literary associations, was the
notion of a mountain of loadstone in the Indian ocean, which prevented
access to the torrid zone by drawing the nails from ships and thus
wrecking them. This imaginary mountain, with some variations in the
description, is made to carry a serious geographical argument by the
astrologer Pietro d' Abano, in his book <i>Conciliator Differentiarum</i>,
written about 1312. (See Major, <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i>, p. 100.)

<strong>Footnote 369:</strong> Ferdinand Columbus tells us that this objection was urged
against the Portuguese captains and afterwards against his father: "E
altri di ciò quasi così disputavano, come già i Portoghesi intorno al
navigare in Guinea; dicendo che, se si allargasse alcuno a far cammino
diritto al occidente, come l' Ammiraglio diceva, non potrebbe poi
tornare in Ispagna per la rotondità della sfera; tenendo per certissime,
che qualunque uscisse del emisperio conosciuto da Tolomeo, anderebbe in
giù, e poi gli sarebbe impossibile dar la volta; e affermando che ciò
sarebbe quasi uno ascendere all' insù di un monte. Il che non potrebbono
fare i navigli con grandissimo vento." <i>Vita deli' Ammiraglio</i>, Venice,
1571, cap. xii. The same thing is told, in almost the same words, by Las
Casas, since both writers followed the same original documents: "Añidian
mas, que quien navegase por vía derecha la vuelta del poniente, como el
Cristóbal Colon proferia, no podria despues volver, suponiendo que el
mundo era redondo y yendo hácia el occidente iban cuesta abajo, y
saliendo del hemisferio que Ptolomeo escribiò, á la vuelta érales
necesario subir cuesta arriba, lo que los navíos era imposible hacer."
The gentle but keen sarcasm that follows is very characteristic of Las
Casas: "Esta era gentil y profunda razon, y señal de haber bien el
negocio entendido!" <i>Historia de las Indias</i>, tom. i. p. 230.<a href="#footnotetag369"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 385:</strong> Perestrelo had with him a female rabbit which littered on

illustrated the fearful rate of multiplication of which organisms are
capable in the absence of enemies or other adverse circumstances to
check it. (Darwin, <i>Origin of Species</i>, chap. iii.) These rabbits
swarmed all over the island and devoured every green and succulent
thing, insomuch that they came near converting it into a desert. Prince
Henry's enemies, who were vexed at the expenditure of money in such
colonizing enterprises, were thus furnished with a wonderful argument.
They maintained that God had evidently created those islands for beasts
alone, not for men! "En este tiempo habia en todo Portugal grandísimas
murmuraciones del Infante, viéndolo tan cudicioso y poner tanta
diligencia en el descubrir de la tierra y costa de África, diciendo que
destruia el reino en los gastos que hacia, y consumia los vecinos dél en

<strong>Footnote 389:</strong> It was in the course of these voyages upon the African
coast that civilized Europeans first became familiar with people below
the upper status of barbarism. Savagery and barbarism of the lower types
were practically unknown in the Middle Ages, and almost, though probably
not quite unknown, to the civilized peoples of the Mediterranean in
ancient times. The history of the two words is interesting. The Greek
word
&#946;&#8049;&#961;&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;, whence Eng.
<i>barbarian</i> (=Sanskrit <i>barbara</i>, Latin <i>balbus</i>), means "a stammerer,"
or one who talks gibberish, i. e. in a language we do not understand.
Aristophanes (<i>Aves</i>, 199) very prettily applies the epithet to the
inarticulate singing of birds. The names <i>Welsh</i>, <i>Walloon</i>,
<i>Wallachian</i>, and <i>Belooch</i>, given to these peoples by their neighbours,
have precisely the same meaning (Kuhn's <i>Zeitschrift</i>, ii. 252); and in
like manner the Russians call the Germans <i>Nyemetch</i>, or people who
cannot talk (Schafarik, <i>Slawische Alterthumer</i>, i. 443; Pott, <i>Etym.
Forsch.</i>, ii. 521). The Greeks called all men but themselves barbarians,
including such civilized people as the Persians. The Romans applied the
name to all tribes and nations outside the limits of the Empire, and the
Italians of the later Middle Ages bestowed it upon all nations outside
of Italy. Upon its lax use in recent times I have already commented
(above, pp. <a href="#page025">25</a>-35). The tendency to apply the epithet to savages is
modern. The word <i>savage</i>, on the other hand, which came to us as the
Old French <i>sauvage</i> or <i>salvage</i> (Ital. <i>selvaggio</i>, <i>salvatico</i>), is
the Latin <i>silvaticus</i>, <i>sylvaticus</i>, <i>salvaticus</i>, that which pertains
to a forest and is sylvan or wild. In its earliest usage it had
reference to plants and beasts rather than to men. Wild apples, pears,
or laurels are characterized by the epithet <i>sylvaticus</i> in Varro, <i>De
re rustica</i>, i. 40; and either this adjective, or its equivalent
<i>silvestris</i>, was used of wild animals as contrasted with domesticated
beasts, as wild sheep and wild fowl, in Columella, vii. 2; viii. 12, or
wolves, in Propertius, iii. 7, or mice, in Pliny, xxx. 22. (Occasionally
it is used of men, as in Pliny, viii. 79.) The meaning was the same in
mediæval Latin (Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, Niort, 1886, tom. vii. p. 686)
and in Old French, as "La douce voiz du loussignol sauvage" (Michel,
<i>Chansons de chatelain de Coucy</i>, xix.). In the romance of <i>Robert le
Diable</i>, in the verses</p>

<p class="poem20">
Sire, se vos fustes Sauvages<br>
Viers moi, je n'i pris mie garde, etc.,</p>

<p class="noindent">the reference is plainly to degenerate civilized men frequenting the
forests, such as bandits or outlaws, not to what we call savages.</p>

<p>Mediæval writers certainly had some idea of savages, but it was not
based upon any actual acquaintance with such people, but upon
imperfectly apprehended statements of ancient writers. At the famous
ball at the Hotel de Saint Pol in Paris, in 1393, King Charles VI. and
five noblemen were dressed in close-fitting suits of linen, thickly
covered from head to foot with tow or flax, the colour of hair, so as to
look like "savages." In this attire nobody recognized them, and the Duke
of Orleans, in his eagerness to make out who they were, brought a torch
too near, so that the flax took fire, and four of the noblemen were
burned to death. See Froissart's <i>Chronicles</i>, tr. Johnes, London, 1806,
vol. xi. pp. 69-76. The point of the story is that savages were supposed
to be men covered with hair, like beasts, and Froissart, in relating it,
evidently knew no better. Whence came this notion of hairy men? Probably
from Hanno's gorillas (see above, p. <a href="#page301">301</a>), through Pliny, whose huge
farrago of facts and fancies was a sort of household Peter Parley in
mediæval monasteries. Pliny speaks repeatedly of men covered with hair
from head to foot, and scatters them about according to his fancy, in
Carmania and other distant places (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, vi. 28, 36, vii. 2).</p>

<p>Greek and Roman writers seem to have had some slight knowledge of
savagery and the lower status of barbarism as prevailing in remote
places ("Ptolomée dit que es extremités de la terre habitable sont gens
sauvages," Oresme, <i>Les Éthiques d'Aristote</i>, Paris, 1488), but their
remarks are usually vague. Seldom do we get such a clean-cut statement
as that of Tacitus about the Finns, that they have neither horses nor
houses, sleep on the ground, are clothed in skins, live by the chase,
and for want of iron use bone-tipped arrows (<i>Germania</i>, cap. 46). More
often we have unconscionable yarns about men without noses, or with only
one eye, tailed men, solid-hoofed men, Amazons, and parthenogenesis. The
Troglodytes, or Cave-dwellers, on the Nubian coast of the Red Sea seem
to have been in the middle status of barbarism (Diodorus, iii. 32;
Agatharchides, 61-63), and the Ichthyophagi, or Fish-eaters, whom
Nearchus found on the shores of Gedrosia (Arrian, <i>Indica</i>, cap. 29),
were probably in a lower stage, perhaps true savages. It is exceedingly
curious that Mela puts a race of pygmies at the headwaters of the Nile
(see map above, p. <a href="#img014">304</a>). Is this only an echo from <i>Iliad</i>, iii. 6, or
can any ancient traveller have penetrated far enough inland toward the
equator to have heard reports of the dwarfish race lately visited by
Stanley (<i>In Darkest Africa</i>, vol. ii. pp. 100-104, 164)? Strabo had no
real knowledge of savagery in Africa (cf. Bunbury, <i>Hist. Ancient
Geog.</i>, ii. 331). Sataspes may have seen barbarians of low type,
possibly on one of the Canary isles (see description of Canarians in
Major's <i>Prince Henry</i>, p. 212). Ptolemy had heard of an island of
cannibals in the Indian ocean, perhaps one of the Andaman group, visited
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1293 by Marco Polo. The people of these islands rank among the
lowest savages on the earth, and Marco was disgusted and horrified;
their beastly faces, with huge prognathous jaws and projecting canine
teeth, he tried to describe by calling them a dog-headed people. Sir
Henry Yule suggests that the mention of Cynocephali, or Dog-heads, in
ancient writers may have had an analogous origin (<i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. ii.

few real glimpses of savagery vouchsafed to Europeans before the
fifteenth century; and a general review of the subject brings out in a

<strong>Footnote 404:</strong> Twenty years ago M. Harrisse published in Spanish and
French a critical essay maintaining that the <i>Vita dell' Ammiraglio</i> was
not written by Ferdinand Columbus, but probably by the famous scholar
Perez de Oliva, professor in the university of Salamanca, who died in
1530 (<i>D. Fernando Colon, historiador de su padre</i>, Seville, 1871;
<i>Fernand Colomb: sa vie, ses &oelig;uvres</i>, Paris, 1872). The Spanish
manuscript of the book had quite a career. As already observed, it is
clear that Las Casas used it, probably between 1552 and 1561. From
Ferdinand's nephew, Luis Columbus, it seems to have passed in 1568 into
the hands of Baliano di Fornari, a prominent citizen of Genoa, who sent
it to Venice with the intention of having it edited and published with
Latin and Italian versions. All that ever appeared, however, was the
Italian version made by Ulloa and published in 1571. Harrisse supposes
that the Spanish manuscript, written by Oliva, was taken to Genoa by
some adventurer and palmed off upon Baliano di Fornari as the work of
Ferdinand Columbus. But inasmuch as Harrisse also supposes that Oliva
probably wrote the book (about 1525) at Seville, under Ferdinand's eyes
and with documents furnished by him, it becomes a question, in such
case, how far was Oliva anything more than an amanuensis to Ferdinand?
and there seems really to be precious little wool after so much loud
crying. If the manuscript was actually written "sous les yeux de Fernand
et avec documents fournis par lui," most of the arguments alleged to
prove that it could not have emanated from the son of Columbus fall to
the ground. It becomes simply a question whether Ulloa may have here and
there tampered with the text, or made additions of his own. To some
extent he seems to have done so, but wherever the Italian version is
corroborated by the Spanish extracts in Las Casas, we are on solid
ground, for Las Casas died five years before the Italian version was
published. M. Harrisse does not seem as yet to have convinced many
scholars. His arguments have been justly, if somewhat severely,
characterized by my old friend, the lamented Henry Stevens (<i>Historical
Collections</i>, London, 1881, vol. i. No. 1379), and have been elaborately
refuted by M. d'Avezac, <i>Le livre de Ferdinand Colomb: revue critique
des allegations proposées contre son authenticité</i>, Paris, 1873; and by
Prospero Peragallo, <i>L' autenticità delle Historie di Fernando Colombo</i>,
Genoa, 1884. See also Fabié, <i>Vida de Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas</i>,

(say) 18 in 1436 she must have borne a child at the age of 50. That
would be unusual, but not unprecedented. But M. Harrisse (tom. ii. p.
214), from a more thorough sifting of this documentary evidence, seems
to have proved that while Giacomo cannot have been born later than 1468
he may have been born as early as 1460; so that whatever is left of M.

haste and excitement, Columbus left out a little word; or shall we blame
the proof-reader? Avezac himself translates it "il y a plus de quarante

<strong>Footnote 415:</strong> That was the golden age of sumptuary laws. Because
Alfonso XI. of Castile (1312-1350), when he tried to impress horses for
the army, found it hard to get as many as he wanted, he took it into his
head that his subjects were raising too many mules and not enough
horses. So he tried to remedy the evil by a wholesale decree prohibiting
all Castilians from riding upon mules! In practice this precious decree,
like other villainous prohibitory laws that try to prevent honest people
from doing what they have a perfect right to do, proved so vexatious and
ineffective withal that it had to be perpetually fussed with and
tinkered. One year you could ride a mule and the next year you couldn't.
In 1492, as we shall see, Columbus immortalized one of these patient
beasts by riding it a few miles from Granada. But in 1494 Ferdinand and
Isabella decreed that nobody except women, children, and clergymen could
ride on mules,&mdash;"dont la marche est beaucoup plus douce que celle des
chevaux" (Humboldt, <i>Examen critique</i>, tom. iii. p. 338). This edict
remained in force in 1505, so that the Discoverer of the New World, the
inaugurator of the greatest historic event since the birth of Christ,
could not choose an easygoing animal for the comfort of his weary old
weather-shaken bones without the bother of getting a special edict to
fit his case. <i>Eheu, quam parva sapientia regitur mundus!</i><a href="#footnotetag415"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

Angleterre ou dans l'isle de Corse." Harrisse, tom. i. p. 217. In
Cogoleto, about sixteen miles west of Genoa on the Corniche road, the
visitor is shown a house where Columbus is said first to have seen the
light. Upon its front is a quaint inscription in which the discoverer is
compared to the dove (<i>Colomba</i>) which, when sent by Noah from the ark,
discovered dry land amid the waters:&mdash;</p>

<strong>Footnote 423:</strong> The date 1470 rests upon a letter of Columbus to King
Ferdinand of Aragon in May, 1505. He says that God must have directed
him into the service of Spain by a kind of miracle, since he had already
been in Portugal, whose king was more interested than any other
sovereign in making discoveries, and yet God closed his eyes, his ears,
and all his senses to such a degree that <i>in fourteen years</i> Columbus
could not prevail upon him to lend aid to his scheme. "Dije
milagrosamente porque fui á aportar á Portugal, adonde el Rey de allí
entendia en el descubrir mas que otro: él le atajó la vista, oido y
todos los sentidos, que en catorce años no le pude hacer entender lo que
yo dije." Las Casas, <i>op. cit.</i> tom. iii. p. 187; Navarrete, tom. iii.
p. 528. Now it is known that Columbus finally left Portugal late in
1484, or very early in 1485, so that fourteen years would carry us back
to before 1471 for the first arrival of Columbus in that country. M.
Harrisse (<i>op. cit.</i> tom. i. p. 263) is unnecessarily troubled by the
fact that the same person was not king of Portugal during the whole of
that period. Alfonso V. (brother of Henry the Navigator) died in 1481,
and was succeeded by his son John II.; but during a considerable part of
the time between 1475 and 1481 the royal authority was exercised by the
latter. Both kings were more interested in making discoveries than any
other European sovereigns. Which king did Columbus mean? Obviously his
words were used loosely; he was too much preoccupied to be careful about
trifles; he probably had John in his mind, and did not bother himself
about Alfonso; King Ferdinand, to whom he was writing, did not need to
have such points minutely specified, and could understand an elliptical
statement; and the fact stated by Columbus was simply that during a
residence of fourteen years in Portugal he had not been able to enlist
even that enterprising government in behalf of his novel scheme.</p>

<p>In the town archives of Savona we find Christopher Columbus witnessing a
document March 20, 1472, endorsing a kind of promissory note for his
father August 26, 1472, and joining with his mother and his next brother
Giovanni, August 7, 1473, in relinquishing all claims to the house in
Genoa sold by his father Domenico by deed of that date. It will be
remembered that Domenico had moved from Genoa to Savona in 1471. From
these documents (which are all printed in his <i>Christophe Colomb</i>, tom.
ii. pp. 419, 420, 424-426) M. Harrisse concludes that Christopher cannot
have gone to Portugal until after August 7, 1473. Probably not, so far
as to be domiciled there; but inasmuch as he had long been a sailor, why
should he not have been in Portugal, or upon the African coast in a
Portuguese ship, in 1470 and 1471, and nevertheless have been with his
parents in Savona in 1472 and part of 1473? His own statement "fourteen
years" is not to be set aside on such slight grounds as this.
Furthermore, from the fact that Bartholomew's name is not signed to the
deed of August 7, 1473, M. Harrisse infers that he was then a minor; i.
e. under five and twenty. But it seems to me more likely that
Bartholomew was already domiciled at Lisbon, since we are expressly told
by two good contemporary authorities&mdash;both of them Genoese writers
withal&mdash;that he moved to Lisbon and began making maps there at an
earlier date than Christopher. See Antonio Gallo, <i>De navigatione
Columbi per inaccessum antea Oceanum Commentariolus</i>, apud Muratori,
tom. xxiii. col. 301-304; Giustiniani, <i>Psalterium</i>, Milan, 1516
(annotation to Psalm xix.); Harrisse, <i>Bibliotheca Americana
Vetustissima</i>, No. 88. To these statements M. Harrisse objects that he
finds (in Belloro, <i>Notizie</i>, p. 8) mention of a document dated Savona,
June 16, 1480, in which Domenico Colombo gives a power of attorney to
his son Bartholomew to act for him in some matter. The document itself,
however, is not forthcoming, and the notice cited by M. Harrisse really
affords no ground for the assumption that Bartholomew was in 1480
domiciled at Savona or at Genoa.<a href="#footnotetag423"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 429:</strong> Upon that island his eldest son Diego was born. This
whole story of the life upon Porto Santo and its relation to the genesis
of Columbus's scheme is told very explicitly by Las Casas, who says that
it was told to him by Diego Columbus at Barcelona in 1519, when they
were waiting upon Charles V., just elected Emperor and about to start
for Aachen to be crowned. And yet there are modern critics who are
disposed to deny the whole story. (See Harrisse, tom. i. p. 298.) The
grounds for doubt are, however, extremely trivial when confronted with

<strong>Footnote 433:</strong> I translate this enclosed letter from the original Latin
text, as found, a few years ago, in the handwriting of Columbus upon the
fly-leaves of his copy of the <i>Historia rerum ubique gestarum</i> of Æneas
Sylvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II.), published at Venice in 1477, in
folio, and now preserved in the Colombina at Seville. This Latin text is
given by Harrisse, in his <i>Fernand Colomb</i>, pp. 178-180, and also (with
more strict regard to the abbreviations of the original) in his
<i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima&mdash;Additions</i>, Paris, 1872, pp.
xvi.-xviii. Very likely Columbus had occasion to let the original MS. go
out of his hands, and so preserved a copy of it upon the fly-leaves of
one of his books. These same fly-leaves contain extracts from Josephus
and Saint Augustine. The reader will rightly infer from my translation
that the astronomer's Latin was somewhat rugged and lacking in literary
grace. Apparently he was anxious to jot down quickly what he had to say,
and get back to his work.<a href="#footnotetag433"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 434:</strong> A sketch of this most memorable of maps is given
opposite. Columbus carried it with him upon his first voyage, and shaped
his course in accordance with it. Las Casas afterwards had it in his
possession (<i>Hist. de las Indias</i>, tom. i. pp. 96, 279). It has since
been lost, that is to say, it may still be in existence, but nobody
knows where. But it has been so well described that the work of
restoring its general outlines is not difficult and has several times
been done. The sketch here given is taken from Winsor (<i>Narr. and Crit.
Hist.</i>, ii. 103), who takes it from <i>Das Ausland</i>, 1867, p. 5. Another
restoration may be found in St. Martin's <i>Atlas</i>, pl. ix. This map was

<strong>Footnote 440:</strong> On modern maps Hang-chow. After 1127 that city was for
some time the capital of China, and Marco Polo's name <i>Quinsay</i>
represents the Chinese word <i>King-sse</i> or "capital," now generally
applied to Peking. Marco Polo calls it the finest and noblest city in
the world. It appears that he does not overstate the circumference of
its walls at 100 Chinese miles or <i>li</i>, equivalent to about 30 English
miles. It has greatly diminished since Polo's time, while other cities
have grown. Toscanelli was perhaps afraid to repeat Polo's figure as to
the number of stone bridges; Polo says there were 12,000 of them, high
enough for ships to pass under! We thus see how his Venetian
fellow-citizens came to nickname him "Messer Marco Milione." As Colonel
Yule says, "I believe we must not bring Marco to book for the literal
accuracy of his statements as to the bridges; but all travellers have
noticed the number and elegance of the bridges of cut stone in this part
of China." <i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. ii, p. 144.<a href="#footnotetag440"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

He sets out to demonstrate to Columbus that the part of the voyage to be
accomplished through new and unfamiliar stretches of the Atlantic is not
great; but he is so full of the glories of Cathay and Cipango that he
keeps reverting to that subject, to the manifest detriment of his

hemisphere, for although the earth is as round as a wheel, yet the water
at any given point is a plane, and inasmuch as all things tend to a

<strong>Footnote 447:</strong> It was formerly assumed, without hesitation, that the
letter from Toscanelli to Columbus was written and sent in 1474. The
reader will observe, however, that while the enclosed letter to Martinez
is dated June 25, 1474, the letter to Columbus, in which it was
enclosed, has no date. But according to the text as given in <i>Vita dell'
Ammiraglio</i>, cap. viii., this would make no difference, for the letter
to Columbus was sent only a few days later than the original letter to
Martinez: "I send you a copy of another letter, which I wrote a few days
ago (<i>alquanti giorni fa</i>) to a friend of mine, a gentleman of the
household of the king of Portugal before the wars of Castile, in reply
to another," etc. This friend, Martinez, had evidently been a gentleman
of the household of Alfonso V. since before the civil wars of Castile,
which in 1474 had been going on intermittently for nine years under the
feeble Henry IV., who did not die until December 12, 1474. Toscanelli
apparently means to say "a friend of mine who has for ten years or more
been a gentleman of the royal household," etc.; only instead of
mentioning the number of years, he alludes less precisely (as most
people, and perhaps especially old people, are apt to do) to the most
notable, mentionable, and glaring fact in the history of the Peninsula
for that decade,&mdash;namely, the civil wars of Castile. As if an American
writer in 1864 had said, "a friend of mine, who has been secretary to A.
B. since before the war," instead of saying "for four years or more."
This is the only reasonable interpretation of the phrase as it stands
above, and it was long ago suggested by Humboldt (<i>Examen critique</i>,
tom. i. p. 225). Italian and Spanish writers of that day, however, were
lavish with their commas and sprinkled them in pretty much at haphazard.
In this case Ferdinand's translator, Ulloa, sprinkled in one comma too
many, and it fell just in front of the clause "before the wars of
Castile;" so that Toscanelli's sentence was made to read as follows: "I
send you a copy of another letter, which I wrote a few days ago to a
friend of mine, a gentleman of the household of the king of Portugal,
before the wars of Castile, in reply to another," etc. Now this unhappy
comma, coming after the word "Portugal," has caused ream after ream of
good paper to be inked up in discussion, for it has led some critics to
understand the sentence as follows: "I send you a copy of another
letter, which I wrote a few days ago, before the wars of Castile, to a
friend of mine," etc. This reading brought things to a pretty pass.
Evidently a letter dated June 25, 1474, could not have been written
before the civil wars of Castile, which began in 1465. It was therefore
assumed that the phrase must refer to the "War of Succession" between
Castile and Portugal (in some ways an outgrowth from the civil wars of
Castile) which began in May, 1475, and ended in September, 1479. M.
d'Avezac thinks that the letter to Columbus must have been written after
the latter date, or more than five years later than the enclosed letter.
M. Harrisse is somewhat less exacting, and is willing to admit that it
may have been written at any time after this war had fairly begun,&mdash;say
in the summer of 1475, not more than a year or so later than the
enclosed letter. Still he is disposed on some accounts to put the date
as late as 1482. The phrase <i>alquanti giorni fa</i> will not allow either
of these interpretations. It means "a few days ago," and cannot possibly
mean a year ago, still less five years ago. The Spanish retranslator
from Ulloa renders it exactly <i>algunos dias há</i> (Navarrete, <i>Coleccion</i>,
tom. ii. p. 7), and Humboldt (<i>loc. cit.</i>) has it <i>il y a quelques
jours</i>. If we could be sure that the expression is a correct rendering
of the lost Latin original, we might feel sure that the letter to
Columbus must have been written as early as the beginning of August,
1474. But now the great work of Las Casas, after lying in manuscript for
314 years, has at length been published in 1875. Las Casas gives a
Spanish version of the Toscanelli letters (<i>Historia de las Indias</i>,
tom. i. pp. 92-97), which is unquestionably older than Ulloa's Italian
version, though perhaps not necessarily more accurate. The phrase in Las
Casas is not <i>algunos dias há</i>, but <i>há dias</i>, i. e. not "a few days
ago," but "some time ago." Just which expression Toscanelli used cannot
be determined unless somebody is fortunate enough to discover the lost
Latin original. The phrase in Las Casas admits much more latitude of
meaning than the other. I should suppose that <i>há dias</i> might refer to
an event a year or two old, which would admit of the interpretation
considered admissible by M. Harrisse. I should hardly suppose that it
could refer to an event five or six years old; if Toscanelli had been
referring in 1479 or 1480 to a letter written in 1474, his phrase would
probably have appeared in Spanish as <i>algunos años há</i>, i. e. "a few
years ago," not as <i>há dias</i>. M. d'Avezac's hypothesis seems to me not
only inconsistent with the phrase <i>há dias</i>, but otherwise improbable.
The frightful anarchy in Castile, which began in 1465 with the attempt
to depose Henry IV. and alter the succession, was in great measure a
series of ravaging campaigns and raids, now more general, now more
local, and can hardly be said to have come to an end before Henry's
death in 1474. The war which began with the invasion of Castile by
Alfonso V. of Portugal, in May, 1475, was simply a later phase of the
same series of conflicts, growing out of disputed claims to the crown
and rivalries among great barons, in many respects similar to the
contemporary anarchy in England called the Wars of the Roses. It is not
likely that Toscanelli, writing at any time between 1475 and 1480, and
speaking of the "wars of Castile" in the plural, could have had 1474 in
his mind as a date previous to those wars; to his mind it would have
rightly appeared as a date in the midst of them. In any case, therefore,
his reference must be to a time before 1465, and Humboldt's
interpretation is in all probability correct. The letter from Toscanelli
to Columbus was probably written within a year or two after June 25,
1474.</p>

<p>On account of the vast importance of the Toscanelli letters, and because
the early texts are found in books which the reader is not likely to
have at hand, I have given them entire in the Appendix at the end of
this work.<a href="#footnotetag447"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 457:</strong> It was first printed without indication of place or date,
but probably the place was Paris and the date somewhere from 1483 to
1490. Manuscript copies were very common, and Columbus probably knew the
book long before that time. There is a good account of it in Humboldt's
<i>Examen critique</i>, tom. i. pp. 61-76, 96-108. Humboldt thinks that such
knowledge as Columbus had of the opinions of ancient writers was chiefly
if not wholly obtained from Alliacus. It is doubtful if Columbus had any
direct acquaintance with the works of Roger Bacon, but he knew the
<i>Liber Cosmographicus</i> of Albertus Magnus and the <i>Speculum Naturale</i> of
Vincent de Beauvais (both about 1250), and drew encouragement from them.
He also knew the book of Mandeville, first printed in French at Lyons in
1480, and a Latin translation of Marco Polo, published in 1485, a copy

<strong>Footnote 462:</strong> The reader will also notice upon Toscanelli's map the
islands of Brazil and St. Brandan. For an account of all these fabulous
islands see Winsor, <i>Narr. and Crit. Hist.</i>, vol. i. pp. 46-51. The name
of "Antilia" survives in the name "Antilles," applied since about 1502
to the West India islands. All the islands west of Toscanelli's
ninetieth meridian belong in the Pacific. He drew them from his
understanding of the descriptions of Marco Polo, Friar Odoric, and other
travellers. These were the islands supposed, rightly, though vaguely, to
abound in spices.<a href="#footnotetag462"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<p><a id="footnote463" name="footnote463"></a>
<strong>Footnote 463:</strong> Columbus was confirmed in this opinion by the book of the
Arabian astronomer Alfragan, written about <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 950, a Latin
translation of which appeared in 1447. There is a concise summary of it
in Delambre, <i>Histoire de l'astronomie du Moyen Âge</i>, pp. 63-73.
Columbus proceeded throughout on the assumption that the length of a
degree at the equator is 56.6 geographical miles, instead of the correct
figure 60. This would oblige him to reduce all Toscanelli's figures by
about six per cent., to begin with. Upon this point we have the highest
authority, that of Columbus himself, in an autograph marginal note in
his copy of the <i>Imago Mundi</i>, where he expresses himself most
explicitly: "Nota quod sepius navigando ex Ulixbona ad Austrum in
Guineam, notavi cum diligentia viam, ut solitum naucleris et malineriis,
et preteria accepi altitudinem solis cum quadrante et aliis instrumentis
plures vices, et inveni concordare cum Alfragano, videlicet respondere
quemlibet gradum milliariis 56-<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. Quare ad hanc mensuram fidem
adhibendam. Tunc igitur possumus dicere quod circuitus Terræ sub aræ
equinoctiali est 20,400 milliariorum. Similiter que id invenit magister
Josephus phisicus et astrologus et alii plures missi specialiter ad hoc
per serenissimum regem Portugaliæ," etc.; <i>anglicè</i>, "Observe that in
sailing often from Lisbon southward to Guinea, I carefully marked the
course, according to the custom of skippers and mariners, and moreover I
took the sun's altitude several times with a quadrant and other
instruments, and in agreement with Alfragan I found that each degree [i.
e. of longitude, measured on a great circle] answers to 56-<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> miles. So
that one may rely upon this measure. We may therefore say that the
equatorial circumference of the earth is 20,400 miles. A similar result
was obtained by Master Joseph, the physicist [or, perhaps, physician]
and astronomer, and several others sent for this special purpose by the
most gracious king of Portugal."&mdash;Master Joseph was physician to John
II. of Portugal, and was associated with Martin Behaim in the invention
of an improved astrolabe which greatly facilitated ocean
navigation.&mdash;The exact agreement with Ptolemy's figures shows that by a
mile Columbus meant a geographical mile, equivalent to ten Greek
stadia.<a href="#footnotetag463"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<p><a id="footnote464" name="footnote464"></a>
<strong>Footnote 464:</strong> One seventh of 18,000 is 2,571 geographical miles,
equivalent to 2,963 English miles. The actual length of Columbus's first
voyage, from last sight of land in the Canaries to first sight of land
in the Bahamas, was according to his own dead reckoning about 3,230
geographical miles. See his journal in Navarrete, <i>Coleccion</i>, tom. i.
pp. 6-20.</p>

<p>I give here in parallel columns the passage from Bacon and the one from
Alliacus upon which Columbus placed so much reliance. In the Middle Ages
there was a generous tolerance of much that we have since learned to
stigmatize as plagiarism.</p>

<p>Columbus must either have carried the book of Alliacus with him on his
voyages, or else have read his favourite passages until he knew them by
heart, as may be seen from the following passage of a letter, written
from Hispaniola in 1498 to Ferdinand and Isabella (Navarrete, tom i. p.
261):&mdash;"El Aristotel dice que este mundo es pequeño y es el agua muy
poca, y que facilmente se puede pasar de España à las Indias, y esto
confirma el Avenryz [Averroes], y le alega el cardenal Pedro de Aliaco,
autorizando este decir y aquel de Seneca, el qual conforma con estos....
À esto trac una autoridad de Esdras del tercero libro suyo, adonde dice
que de siete partes del mundo las seis son descubiertas y la una es
cubierta de agua, la cual autoridad es aprobada por Santos, los cuales
dan autoridad al 3<sup>o</sup> é 4<sup>o</sup> libro de Esdras, ansí come es S. Agustin é S.
Ambrosio en su <i>exámeron</i>," etc.&mdash;"Singular period," exclaims Humboldt,
"when a mixture of testimonies from Aristotle and Averroes, Esdras and
Seneca, on the small extent of the ocean compared with the magnitude of
continental land, afforded to monarchs guarantees for the safety and
expediency of costly enterprises!" <i>Cosmos</i>, tr. Sabine, vol. ii. p.
250. The passages cited in this note may be found in Humboldt,
<i>Examen critique</i>, tom. i. pp. 65-69. Another interesting passage from

Ammiraglio</i>, cap. iv. In the original edition of 1571, there are no
quotation-marks; and in some modern editions, where these are supplied,
the quotation is wrongly made to end just before the last sentence, so
as to make it appear like a gloss of Ferdinand's. This is, however,
impossible. Ferdinand died in 1539, and the Zeno narrative of Frislanda
was not published till 1558, so that the only source from which that
name could have come into his book was his father's document. The
genuineness of the passage is proved by its recurrence, almost word for

<strong>Footnote 475:</strong> In 1689 the Swedish writer, Ole Rudbeck, could not
understand Adam of Bremen's allusion to Vinland. The passage is
instructive. Rudbeck declares that in speaking of a wine-growing country
near to the Arctic ocean, Adam must have been misled by some poetical or
figurative phrase; he was deceived either by his trust in the Danes, or
by his own credulity, for he manifestly refers to <i>Finland</i>, for which
the form <i>Vinland</i> does not once occur in Sturleson, etc.:&mdash;"Ne tamen

<strong>Footnote 476:</strong> The source of such a confusion of ideas is probably the
ridiculous map in Rafn's <i>Antiquitates Americanæ</i>, upon which North
America is represented in all the accuracy of outline attainable by
modern maps, and then the Icelandic names are put on where Rafn thought
they ought to go, i. e. Markland upon Nova Scotia, Vinland upon New
England, etc. Any person using such a map is liable to forget that it
cannot possibly represent the crude notions of locality to which the
reports of the Norse voyages must have given rise in an ignorant age.
(The reader will find the map reproduced in Winsor, <i>Narr. and Crit.
Hist.</i>, i. 95.) Rafn's fault was, however, no greater than that
committed by the modern makers of so-called "ancient atlases"&mdash;still
current and in use in schools&mdash;when, for example, they take a correct
modern map of Europe, with parts of Africa and Asia, and upon countries
so dimly known to the ancients as Scandinavia and Hindustan, but now
drawn with perfect accuracy, they simply print the ancient names!!
Nothing but confusion can come from using such wretched maps. The only
safe way to study the history of geography is to reproduce the ancient
maps themselves, as I have done in the present work. Many of the maps
given below in the second volume will illustrate the slow and painful
growth of the knowledge of the North American coast during the two
centuries after Columbus.<a href="#footnotetag476"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 479:</strong> For example, the pilot Martin Vicenti told Columbus that
1,200 miles west of Cape St. Vincent he had picked up from the sea a
piece of carved wood evidently not carved with iron tools. Pedro Correa,
who had married Columbus's wife's sister, had seen upon Porto Santo a
similar piece of carving that had drifted from the west. Huge reeds
sometimes floated ashore upon those islands, and had not Ptolemy
mentioned enormous reeds as growing in eastern Asia? Pine-trees of
strange species were driven by west winds upon the coast of Fayal, and
two corpses of men of an unknown race had been washed ashore upon the
neighbouring island of Flores. Certain sailors, on a voyage from the
Azores to Ireland, had caught glimpses of land on the west, and believed
it to be the coast of "Tartary;" etc., etc. See <i>Vita dell' Ammiraglio</i>,

<p>Abraham Ortelius in 1606 speaks of the Northmen coming to America, but
bases his opinion upon the Zeno narrative (published in 1558) and upon
the sound of the name <i>Norumbega</i>, and apparently knows nothing of
Vinland:&mdash;"Iosephus Acosta in his book <i>De Natura noui orbis</i> indeuors
by many reasons to proue, that this part of <i>America</i> was originally
inhabited by certaine Indians, forced thither by tempestuous weather
ouer the South sea which now they call Mare del Zur. But to me it seemes
more probable, out of the historie of the two Zeni, gentlemen of Venice,
... that this New World many ages past was entred upon by some islanders
of <i>Europe</i>, as namely of <i>Gr&oelig;nland</i>, Island, and Frisland; being
much neerer thereunto than the Indians, nor disioyned thence ... by an
Ocean so huge, and to the Indians so vnnauigable. Also, what else may we
coniecture to be signified by this <i>Norumbega</i> [the name of a North
region of <i>America</i>] but that from <i>Norway</i>, signifying a North land,
some Colonie in times past hath hither beene transplanted?" <i>Theatre of
the Whole World</i>, London, 1606, p. 5. These passages are quoted and
discussed by Reeves, <i>The Finding of Wineland the Good</i>, pp. 95, 96. The
supposed connection of <i>Norumbega</i> with <i>Norway</i> is very doubtful.
Possibly Stephanius, in his map of 1570 (Torfæus, <i>Gronlandia antiqua</i>,
1706), may have had reference to Labrador or the north of Newfoundland.<a href="#footnotetag481"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 485:</strong> The Portuguese have never been able to forgive Columbus
for discovering a new world for Spain, and their chagrin sometimes vents
itself in amusing ways. After all, says Cordeiro, Columbus was no such
great man as some people think, for he did not discover what he promised
to discover; and, moreover, the Portuguese geographers were right in
condemning his scheme, because it really is not so far by sea from
Lisbon around Africa to Hindustan as from Lisbon by any practicable
route westward to Japan! See Luciano Cordeiro, <i>De la part prise par les
Portugais dans la découverte d'Amérique</i>, Lisbon, 1876, pp. 23, 24, 29,
30. Well, I don't know that there is any answer to be made to this

<strong>Footnote 487:</strong> It has been urged in the king's defence that "such a
proceeding was not an instance of bad faith or perfidy (!) but rather of
the policy customary at that time, which consisted in distrusting
everything that was foreign, and in promoting by whatever means the
national glory." Yes, indeed, whether the means were fair or foul. Of
course it was a common enough policy, but it was lying and cheating all
the same. "Não foi sem duvida por mà fè ou perfidia que tacitamente se
mandon armar hum navio à cujo capitão se confiou o plano que Colombo
havia proposto, e cuja execuçao se lhe encarregou; mas sim por seguir a
politica naquelle tempo usada, que toda consistia em olhar com
desconfiança para tudo o que era estrangeiro, e en promover por todos os
modos a gloria nacional. O capitão nomeado para a empreza, como não
tivesse nem o espirito, nem a convicção de Colombo, depois de huma curta
viagem nos mares do Oeste, fez-se na volta da terra: e arribou à Lisboa
descontente e desanimado." Campe, <i>Historia do descobrimento da

<strong>Footnote 488:</strong> It has generally been supposed, on the authority of <i>Vita
dell' Ammiraglio</i>, cap. xi., that his wife had lately died; but an
autograph letter of Columbus, in the possession of his lineal descendant
and representative the present Duke of Veraguas, proves that this is a
mistake. In this letter Columbus says expressly that when he left
Portugal he left wife and children, and never saw them again.
(Navarrete, <i>Coleccion</i>, tom. ii. doc. cxxxvii. p. 255.) As Las Casas,
who knew Diego so well, also supposed his mother to have died before his
father left Portugal, it is most likely that she died soon afterwards.
Ferdinand Columbus says that Diego was left in charge of some friars at
the convent of La Rábida near Palos (<i>loc. cit.</i>); Las Casas is not
quite so sure; he thinks Diego was left with some friend of his father
at Palos, or perhaps (<i>por ventura</i>) at La Rábida. (<i>Historia</i>, tom. i.
p. 227.) These mistakes were easy to make, for both La Rábida and Huelva
were close by Palos, and we know that Diego's aunt Muliar was living at
Huelva. (Las Casas, <i>op. cit.</i> tom. i. p. 241; Harrisse, tom. i. pp.
279, 356, 391; tom. ii. p. 229.) It is pretty clear that Columbus never
visited La Rábida before the autumn of 1491 (see below, p. <a href="#page412">412</a>). My own
notion is that Columbus may have left his wife with an infant and
perhaps one older child, relieving her of the care of Diego by taking
him to his aunt, and intending as soon as practicable to reunite the
family. He clearly did not know at the outset whether he should stay in
Spain or not.<a href="#footnotetag488"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 493:</strong> The authority for Bartholomew Columbus having sailed to
the Cape of Good Hope with Dias is a manuscript note of his own in
Christopher's copy of the <i>Imago Mundi</i>: "Nota quod hoc anno de 88 [it
should be 87] in mense decembri appulit in Ulixbona Bartholomeus Didacus
capitaneus trium carabelarum quem miserat serenissimus rex Portugalie in
Guineam ad tentandum terrain. Et renunciavit ipse serenissimo regi prout
navigaverat ultra jam navigata leuchas 600, videlicet 450 ad austrum et
150 ad aquilonem usque montem per ipsum nominatum <i>Cabo de boa
esperança</i> quem in Agesimba estimamus. Qui quidem in eo loco invenit se
distare per astrolabium ultra lineam equinoctialem gradus 35. Quem
viagium pictavit et scripsit de leucha in leucham in una carta
navigationis ut oculi visum ostenderet ipso serenissimo regi. In quibus
omnibus interfui." M. Varnhagen has examined this note and thinks it is
in the handwriting of Christopher Columbus (<i>Bulletin de Géographie</i>,
janvier, 1858, tom. xv. p. 71); and M. d'Avezac (<i>Canevas
chronologique</i>, p. 58), accepting this opinion, thinks that the words
<i>in quibus omnibus interfui</i>, "in all of which I took part," only mean
that Christopher was present in Lisbon when the expedition returned, and
heard the whole story! With all possible respect for such great scholars
as MM. d'Avezac and Varnhagen, I submit that the opinion of Las Casas,
who first called attention to this note, must be much better than theirs
on such a point as the handwriting of the two brothers. When Las Casas
found the note he wondered whether it was meant for Bartholomew or
Christopher, i. e. wondered which of the two was meant to be described
as having "taken part;" but at all events, says Las Casas, the
handwriting is Bartholomew's:&mdash;"Estas son palabras escritas de la mano
de Bartolomé Colon, no sé si las escribió de sí ó de su letra por su
hermano Cristóbal Colon." Under these circumstances it seems idle to
suppose that Las Casas could have been mistaken about the handwriting;
he evidently put his mind on that point, and in the next breath he goes
on to say, "la letra yo conozco ser de Bartolomé Colon, porque tuve
muchas suyas," i. e. "I know it is Bartholomew's writing, for I have had
many letters of his;" and again "estas palabras ... de la misma letra y
mano de Bartolomé Colon, la cual muy bien conocí y agora tengo hartas
cartas y letras suyas, tratando deste viaje," i. e. "these words ...
from the very writing and hand of Bartholomew Columbus, which I knew
very well, and I have to-day many charts and letters of his, treating of
this voyage." (<i>Hist. de las Indias</i>, tom. i. pp. 213, 214.) This last
sentence makes Las Casas an independent witness to Bartholomew's
presence in the expedition, a matter about which he was not likely to be
mistaken. What puzzled him was the question, not whether Bartholomew
went, but whether Christopher could have gone also, "pudo ser tambien
que se hallase Cristóbal Colon." Now Christopher certainly did not go on
that voyage. The expedition started in August, 1486, and returned to
Lisbon in December, 1487, after an absence of sixteen months and
seventeen days, "anendo dezaseis meses et dezasete dias que erão
partidos delle." (Barros, <i>Decada primeira da Asia</i>, Lisbon, 1752, tom.
i. fol. 42, 44.) The account-book of the treasury of Castile shows that
sums of money were paid to Christopher at Seville, May 5, July 3, August
27, and October 15, 1487; so that he could not have gone with Dias (see
Harrisse, tom. ii. p. 191). Neither could Christopher have been in
Lisbon in December, 1487, when the little fleet returned, for his
safe-conduct from King John is dated March 20, 1488. It was not until
the autumn of 1488 that Columbus made this visit to Portugal, and M.
d'Avezac has got the return of the fleet a year too late. Bartholomew's
note followed a custom which made 1488 begin at Christmas, 1487.</p>

<p>In reading a later chapter of Las Casas for another purpose (tom. i. p.
227), I come again upon this point. He rightly concludes that
Christopher could not have gone with Dias, and again declares most
positively that the handwriting of the note was Bartholomew's and not
Christopher's.</p>

<p>This footnote affords a good illustration of the kind of difficulties

which an excess of ingenuity may discover mare's nests.<a href="#footnotetag493"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 496:</strong> The entry, as given by Las Casas, is "Pro authore, seu
pictore, &#9553; Gennua cui patria est, nomen cui Bartolomeus &#9553;
Columbus de terra rubea, opus edidit istud &#9553; Londonije: anno domini
millesimo quatercentessimo octiesque uno &#9553; Atque insuper anno octavo:
decimaque die mensis Februarii. &#9553; Laudes Christo cantentur abunde."
<i>Historia</i>, tom. i. p. 225. Now since Bartholomew Columbus was a fairly
educated man, writing this note in England on a map made for the eyes of
the king of England, I suppose he used the old English style which made
the year begin at the vernal equinox instead of Christmas, so that his
February, 1488, means the next month but one after December, 1488, i. e.
what in our new style becomes February, 1489. Bartholomew returned to
Lisbon from Africa in the last week of December, 1487, and it is not
likely that his plans could have been matured and himself settled down
in London in less than seven weeks. The logical relation of the events,
too, shows plainly that Christopher's visit to Lisbon was for the
purpose of consulting his brother and getting first-hand information
about the greatest voyage the world had ever seen. In the early weeks of
1488 Christopher sends his request for a safe-conduct, gets it March 20,
waits till his child is born, August 15, and then presently goes.
Bartholomew may have sailed by the first of October for England, where
(according to this reading of his date) we actually find him four months
later. What happened to him in this interval? Here we come to the story
of the pirates. M. Harrisse, who never loses an opportunity for throwing
discredit upon the <i>Vita dell' Ammiraglio</i>, has failed to make the
correction of date which I have here suggested. He puts Bartholomew in
London in February, 1488, and is thus unable to assign any reason for
Christopher's visit to Lisbon. He also finds that in the forty-six days
between Christmas, 1487, and February, 10, 1488, there is hardly room
enough for any delay due to so grave a cause as capture by pirates.
(<i>Christophe Colomb</i>, vol. ii. p. 192.) He therefore concludes that the
statement in the <i>Vita dell' Ammiraglio</i>, cap. xi., is unworthy of
credit, and it is upon an accumulation of small difficulties like this
that he bases his opinion that Ferdinand Columbus cannot have written
that book. But Las Casas also gives the story of the pirates, and adds
the information that they were "Easterlings," though he cannot say of
what nation, i. e. whether Dutch, German, or perhaps Danes. He says that
Bartholomew was stripped of his money and fell sick, and after his
recovery was obliged to earn money by map-making before he could get to
England. (<i>Historia</i>, tom. i. p. 225.) Could all this have happened
within the four months which I have allowed between October, 1488, and
February, 1489? Voyages before the invention of steamboats were of very
uncertain duration. John Adams in 1784 was fifty-four days in getting
from London to Amsterdam (see my <i>Critical Period of American History</i>,
p. 156). But with favourable weather a Portuguese caravel in 1488 ought
to have run from Lisbon to Bristol in fourteen days or less, so that in
four months there would be time enough for quite a chapter of accidents.
Las Casas, however, says it was <i>a long time</i> before Bartholomew was
able to reach England:&mdash;"Esto fué causa que enfermase y viniese á mucha
pobreza, y estuviese mucho tempo sin poder llegar á Inglaterra, hasta
tanto que quiso Dies sanarle; y reformado algo, por su industria y
trabajos de sus manos, haciendo cartas de marear, llegó á Inglaterra, y,
pasados un dia y otros, hobo de alcanzar que le oyese Enrique VII." It
is impossible, I think, to read this passage without feeling that at
least a year must have been consumed; and I do not think we are entitled
to disregard the words of Las Casas in such a matter. But how shall we
get the time?</p>

<p>Is it possible that Las Casas made a slight mistake in deciphering the
date on Bartholomew's map? Either that mariner did not give the map to
Henry VII., or the king gave it back, or more likely it was made in
duplicate. At any rate Las Casas had it, along with his many other
Columbus documents, and for aught we know it may still be tumbling about
somewhere in the Spanish archives. It was so badly written (<i>de muy mala
é corrupta letra</i>), apparently in abbreviations (<i>sin ortografía</i>), that
Las Casas says he found extreme difficulty in making it out. Now let us
observe that date, which is given in fantastic style, apparently because
the inscription is in a rude doggerel, and the writer seems to have
wished to keep his "verses" tolerably even. (They don't scan much better
than Walt Whitman's.) As it stands, the date reads <i>anno
domini millesimo quatercentessimo octiesque uno atque insuper anno
octavo</i>, i. e. "in the year of our Lord the thousandth, four hundredth,
<span class="smcap">AND EIGHT-TIMES-ONE</span>, and thereafter the eighth year." What business has
this cardinal number <i>octiesque uno</i> in a row of ordinals? If it were
translatable, which it is not, it would give us 1,000 + 400 + 8 + 8 =
1416, an absurd date. The most obvious way to make the passage readable
is to insert the ordinal <i>octogesimo primo</i> instead of the incongruous
<i>octiesque uno</i>; then it will read "in the year of our Lord the
one-thousand-four-hundred-and-eighty-first, and thereafter the eighth
year," that is to say 1489. Now translate old style into new style, and
February, 1489, becomes February, 1490, which I believe to be the
correct date. This allows sixteen months for Bartholomew's mishaps; it
justifies the statement in which Las Casas confirms Ferdinand Columbus;
and it harmonizes with the statement of Lord Bacon: "For Christopherus
Columbus, refused by the king of Portugal (who would not embrace at once
both east and west), employed his brother Bartholomew Columbus unto King
Henry to negotiate for his discovery. And it so fortuned that he was
taken by pirates at sea; by which accidental impediment he was long ere
he came to the king; so long that before he had obtained a capitulation
with the king for his brother the enterprise was achieved, and so the
West Indies by Providence were then reserved for the crown of Castilia."
<i>Historie of the Raygne of K. Henry the Seventh</i>, Bacon's <i>Works</i>,
Boston, 1860, vol. xi. p. 296. Lord Bacon may have taken the statement
from Ferdinand's biography; but it probably agreed with English
traditions, and ought not to be slighted in this connection.<a href="#footnotetag496"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 503:</strong> My account of these proceedings at La Rábida differs in
some particulars from any heretofore given, and I think gets the events
into an order of sequence that is at once more logical and more in
harmony with the sources of information than any other. The error of
Ferdinand Columbus&mdash;a very easy one to commit, and not in the least
damaging to his general character as biographer&mdash;lay in confusing his
father's two real visits (in 1484 and 1491) to Huelva with two visits
(one imaginary in 1484 and one real in 1491) to La Rábida, which was
close by, between Huelva and Palos. The visits were all the more likely
to get mixed up in recollection because in each case their object was
little Diego and in each case he was left in charge of somebody in that
neighbourhood. The confusion has been helped by another for which
Ferdinand is not responsible, viz.: the friar Juan Perez has been
confounded with another friar Antonio de Marchena, who Columbus says was
the only person who from the time of his first arrival in Spain had
always befriended him and never mocked at him. These worthy friars twain
have been made into one (e. g. "the prior of the convent, Juan Perez de
Marchena," Irving's <i>Columbus</i>, vol. i. p. 128), and it has often been
supposed that Marchena's acquaintance began with Columbus at La Rábida
in 1484, and that Diego was left at the convent at that time. But some
modern sources of information have served at first to bemuddle, and then
when more carefully sifted, to clear up the story. In 1508 Diego
Columbus brought suit against the Spanish crown to vindicate his claim
to certain territories discovered by his father, and there was a long
investigation in which many witnesses were summoned and past events were
busily raked over the coals. Among these witnesses were Rodriguez
Cabejudo and the physician Garcia Fernandez, who gave from personal
recollection a very lucid account of the affairs at La Rábida. These
proceedings are printed in Navarrete, <i>Coleccion de viages</i>, tom. iii.
pp. 238-591. More recently the publication of the great book of Las
Casas has furnished some very significant clues, and the elaborate
researches of M. Harrisse have furnished others. (See Las Casas, lib. i.
cap. xxix., xxxi.; Harrisse, tom. i. pp. 341-372; tom. ii. pp.
237-231; cf. Peragallo, <i>L' autenticità</i>, etc., pp.
117-134.)&mdash;It now seems clear that Marchena, whom Columbus knew from his
first arrival in Spain, was not associated with La Rábida. At that time
Columbus left Diego, a mere infant, with his wife's sister at Huelva.
Seven years later, intending to leave Spain forever, he went to Huelva
and took Diego, then a small boy. On his way from Huelva to the Seville
road, and thence to Cordova (where he would have been joined by Beatriz
and Ferdinand), he happened to pass by La Rábida, where up to that time
he was evidently unknown, and to attract the attention of the prior Juan
Perez, and the wheel of fortune suddenly and unexpectedly turned. As
Columbus's next start was not for France, but for Granada, his boy was
left in charge of two trustworthy persons. On May 8, 1492, the little
Diego was appointed page to Don John, heir-apparent to the thrones of
Castile and Aragon, with a stipend of 9,400 maravedis. On February 19,
1498, after the death of that young prince, Diego became page to Queen
Isabella.<a href="#footnotetag503"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<p><a id="footnote504" name="footnote504"></a>
<strong>Footnote 504:</strong> In popular allusions to Columbus it is quite common to
assume or imply that he encountered nothing but opposition from the
clergy. For example the account in Draper's <i>Conflict between Science
and Religion</i>, p. 161, can hardly be otherwise understood by the reader.
But observe that Marchena who never mocked at Columbus, Juan Perez who
gave the favourable turn to his affairs, the great prelates Deza and
Mendoza, and the two treasurers Santangel and Quintanilla, were every
one of them priests! Without cordial support from the clergy no such
enterprise as that of Columbus could have been undertaken, in Spain at
least. It is quite right that we should be free-thinkers; and it is also
desirable that we should have some respect for facts.<a href="#footnotetag504"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<p><a id="footnote505" name="footnote505"></a>
<strong>Footnote 505:</strong> Our Scandinavian friends are fond of pointing to this
demand of Columbus as an indication that he secretly expected to
"discover America," and not merely to find the way to Asia. But how
about Ferdinand and Isabella, who finally granted what was demanded, and
their ministers who drew up the agreement, to say nothing of the clerks
who engrossed it? What did they all understand by "discovering islands
and continents in the ocean"? Were they all in this precious Vinland
secret? If so, it was pretty well kept. But in truth there was nothing
singular in these stipulations. Portugal paid for discovery in just this
way by granting governorships over islands like the Azores, or long
stretches of continent like Guinea, along with a share of the revenues
yielded by such places. See for example the cases of Gonzalo Cabral,
Fernando Gomez, and others in Major, <i>Prince Henry the Navigator</i>, pp.
238, 321, and elsewhere. In their search for the Indies the Portuguese
were continually finding new lands, and it was likely to be the same
with the western route, which was supposed (see Catalan, Toscanelli, and
Behaim maps) to lead among spice islands innumerable, and to Asiatic
kingdoms whose heathen people had no rights of sovereignty that
Christian monarchs felt bound to respect.<a href="#footnotetag505"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 510:</strong> It is not easy to give an accurate account of the cost of
this most epoch-making voyage in all history. Conflicting statements by
different authorities combine with the fluctuating values of different
kinds of money to puzzle and mislead us. According to M. Harrisse
1,000,000 maravedis would be equivalent to 295,175 francs, or about
59,000 gold dollars of United States money at present values. Las Casas
(tom. i. p. 256) says that the eighth part, raised by Columbus, was
500,000 maravedis (29,500 dollars). Account-books preserved in the
archives of Simancas show that the sums paid from the treasury of
Castile amounted to 1,140,000 maravedis (67,500 dollars). Assuming the
statement of Las Casas to be correct, the amounts contributed would
perhaps have been as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This total seems to me altogether too large for probability, and so does
the last item, which is simply put at the figure necessary to make the
total eight times 29,500. I am inclined to suspect that Las Casas (with
whom arithmetic was not always a strong point) may have got his figures
wrong. The amount of Santangel's loan also depends upon the statement of
Las Casas, and we do not know whether he took it from a document or from
hearsay. Nor do we know whether it should be added to, or included in,
the first item. More likely, I think, the latter. The only item that we
know with documentary certainty is the first, so that our statement
becomes modified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(Cf. Harrisse, tom. i. pp. 391-404.) Unsatisfactory, but certain as far
as it goes. Alas, how often historical statements are thus reduced to
meagreness, after the hypothetical or ill-supported part has been sifted
out! The story that the Pinzon brothers advanced to Columbus his portion
is told by Las Casas, but he very shrewdly doubts it. The famous story
that Isabella pledged her crown jewels (<i>Vita dell' Ammiraglio</i>, cap.
xiv.) has also been doubted, but perhaps on insufficient grounds, by M.
Harrisse. It is confirmed by Las Casas (tom. i. p. 249). According to
one account she pledged them to Santangel in security for his
loan,&mdash;which seems not altogether improbable. See Pizarro y Orellana,

<strong>Footnote 514:</strong> Martin Behaim was born at Nuremberg in 1436, and is said
to have been a pupil of the celebrated astronomer, Regiomontanus, author
of the first almanac published in Europe, and of Ephemerides, of
priceless value to navigators. He visited Portugal about 1480, invented
a new kind of astrolabe, and sailed with it in 1484 as cosmographer in
Diego Cam's voyage to the Congo. On his return to Lisbon he was
knighted, and presently went to live on the island of Fayal, of which
his wife's father was governor. He was a friend of Columbus. Toward 1492
he visited Nuremberg, to look after some family affairs, and while there
"he gratified some of his townspeople by embodying in a globe the
geographical views which prevailed in the maritime countries; and the
globe was finished before Columbus had yet accomplished his voyage. The
next year (1493) Behaim returned to Portugal; and after having been sent
to the Low Countries on a diplomatic mission, he was captured by English
cruisers and carried to England. Escaping finally, and reaching the
Continent, he passes from our view in 1494, and is scarcely heard of
again." (Winsor, <i>Narr. and Crit. Hist.</i>, ii. 104.) He died in May,
1506. A ridiculous story that he anticipated Columbus in the discovery
of America originated in the misunderstanding of an interpolated passage
in the Latin text of Schedel's <i>Registrum</i>, Nuremberg, 1498, p. 290 (the
so-called <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>). See Winsor, <i>op. cit.</i> ii. 34; Major's
<i>Prince Henry</i>, p. 326; Humboldt, <i>Examen critique</i>, tom. i.p. 256;
Murr, <i>Diplomatische Geschichte des Ritters Behaim</i>, Nuremberg, 1778;
Cladera, <i>Investigaciones históricas</i>, Madrid, 1794; Harrisse,
<i>Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima</i>, pp. 37-43.&mdash;The globe made by
Behaim may now be seen in the city hall at Nuremberg. It "is made of
<i>papier-maché</i>, covered with gypsum, and over this a parchment surface
received the drawing; it is twenty inches in diameter." (Winsor, <i>op.
cit.</i> ii. 105.) The portion west of the 330th meridian is evidently
copied from Toscanelli's map. I give below (p. <a href="#page429">429</a>) a sketch (from
Winsor, after Ruge's <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>, p.

<strong>Footnote 515:</strong> The situation of this Sargasso region in mid-ocean seems
to be determined by its character as a quiet neutral ground between the
great ocean-currents that flow past it on every side. Sargasso plants
are found elsewhere upon the surface of the waves, but nowhere else do
they congregate as here. There are reasons for supposing that in ancient
times this region extended nearer to the African coast. Skylax
(<i>Periplus</i>, cap. 109) says that beyond Kerne, at the mouth of Rio d'
Ouro the sea cannot be navigated on account of the mud and seaweed.

(iii. 2, § 7) tunny fish were caught in abundance in the ocean west of
Spain, and were highly valued for the table on account of their fatness
which was due to submarine vegetables on which they fed. Possibly the
reports of these Sargasso meadows may have had some share in suggesting
to Plato his notion of a huge submerged island Atlantis (<i>Timæus</i>, 25;
<i>Kritias</i>, 108; cf. the notion of a viscous sea in Plutarch, <i>De facie
in Orbe Luna</i>, 26), Plato's fancy has furnished a theme for much wild
speculation. See, for example, Bailly, <i>Lettres sur l'Atlantide de
Platon</i>, Paris, 1779. The belief that there can ever have been such an
island in that part of the Atlantic is disposed of by the fact that the
ocean there is nowhere less than two miles in depth. See the beautiful
map of the Atlantic sea-bottom in Alexander Agassiz's <i>Three Cruises of
the Blake</i>, Boston, 1888, vol. i.p. 108, and compare chap. vi. of that
noble work, on "The Permanence of Continents and of Oceanic Basins;" see
also Wallace's <i>Island Life</i>, chap. vi. It was formerly supposed that
the Sargasso plants grow on the sea-bottom, and becoming detached rise
to the surface (Peter Martyr, <i>De rebus oceanicis</i>, dec. iii. lib. v. p.
53; Humboldt, <i>Personal Narrative</i>, book i. chap, i.); but it is now
known that they are simply rooted in the surface water itself.

Casas or Bernaldez or Peter Martyr or Ferdinand Columbus, and it is

own, "which consisted of a group of golden islands amid azure billows.
To these were afterwards added five anchors, with the celebrated motto,
well known as being carved on his sepulchre." Prescott's <i>Ferdinand and

erroneous. See below, p. <a href="#page514">514</a>. Considering the splendour of the reception
given to Columbus, and the great interest felt in his achievement, Mr.
Prescott is surprised at finding no mention of this occasion in the
local annals of Barcelona, or in the royal archives of Aragon. He
conjectures, with some probability, that the cause of the omission may
have been what an American would call "sectional" jealousy. This Cathay
and Cipango business was an affair of Castile's, and, as such, quite
beneath the notice of patriotic Aragonese archivists! That is the way

good reasons for believing that these highly respectable publishers have

<strong>Footnote 529:</strong> "The lands, therefore, which Columbus had visited were
called the West Indies; and as he seemed to have entered upon a vast
region of unexplored countries, existing in a state of nature, the whole
received the comprehensive appellation of the New World." Irving's
<i>Columbus</i>, vol. i. p. 333. These are very grave errors, again involving
the projection of our modern knowledge into the past. The lands which
Columbus had visited were called simply the Indies; it was not until
long after his death, and after the crossing of the Pacific ocean, that
they were distinguished from the East Indies. The <i>New World</i> was not at
first a "comprehensive appellation" for the countries discovered by
Columbus; it was at first applied to one particular region never visited
by him, viz. to that portion of the southeastern coast of South America
first explored by Vespucius. See vol. ii. pp. 129, 130.<a href="#footnotetag529"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

and Isabella is preserved in the Archives of the Indies at Seville; it

Leibnitz, <i>Codex Diplomaticus</i>, tom. i. pt. i. p. 471. It is often
called the Bull "Inter Cetera," from its opening words.</p>

<p>The origin of the pope's claim to apostolic authority for giving away
kingdoms is closely connected with the fictitious "Donation of
Constantine," an edict probably fabricated in Rome about the middle of
the eighth century. The title of the old Latin text is <i>Edictum domini
Constantini Imp.</i>, apud Pseudo-Isidorus, <i>Decretalia</i>. Constantine's
transfer of the seat of empire from the Tiber to the Bosphorus tended
greatly to increase the dignity and power of the papacy, and I presume
that the fabrication of this edict, four centuries afterward, was the
expression of a sincere belief that the first Christian emperor <i>meant</i>
to leave the temporal supremacy over Italy in the hands of the Roman
see. The edict purported to be such a donation from Constantine to Pope
Sylvester I., but the extent and character of the donation was stated
with such vagueness as to allow a wide latitude of interpretation. Its
genuineness was repeatedly called in question, but belief in it seems to
have grown in strength until after the thirteenth century. Leo IX., who
was a strong believer in its genuineness, granted in 1054 to the Normans
their conquests in Sicily and Calabria, to be held as a fief of the
Roman see. (Muratori, <i>Annali d' Italia</i>, tom. vi. pt. ii. p. 245.) It
was next used to sustain the papal claim to suzerainty over the island
of Corsica. A century later John of Salisbury maintained the right of
the pope to dispose "of all <i>islands</i> on which Christ, the Sun of
righteousness, hath shined," and in conformity with this opinion Pope
Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspeare, an Englishman) authorized in 1164 King
Henry II. of England to invade and conquer Ireland. (See Adrian IV.,
<i>Epist.</i> 76, apud Migne, <i>Patrologia</i>, tom. clxxxviii.) Dr. Lanigan, in
treating of this matter, is more an Irishman than a papist, and derides
"this nonsense of the pope's being the head-owner of all Christian
islands." (<i>Ecclesiastical History of Ireland</i>, vol. iv. p.
159.)&mdash;Gregory VII., in working up to the doctrine that all Christian
kingdoms should be held as fiefs under St. Peter (Baronius, <i>Annales</i>,
tom. xvii. p. 430; cf. Villemain, <i>Histoire de Grégoire VII.</i>, Paris,
1873, tom. ii. pp. 59-61), does not seem to have appealed to the
Donation. Perhaps he was shrewd enough to foresee the kind of objection
afterwards raised by the Albigensians, who pithily declared that if the
suzerainty of the popes was derived from the Donation, then they were
successors of Constantine and not of St. Peter. (Moneta Cremonensis,
<i>Adversus Catharos et Waldenses</i>, ed. Ricchini, Rome, 1743, v. 2.) But
Innocent IV. summarily disposed of this argument at the Council of Lyons
in 1245, when he deposed the Emperor Frederick II. and King Sancho II.
of Portugal,&mdash;saying that Christ himself had bestowed temporal as well
as spiritual headship upon St. Peter and his successors, so that
Constantine only gave up to the Church what belonged to it already. The
opposite or Ghibelline theory was eloquently set forth by Dante, in his
treatise <i>De Monarchia</i>; he held that inasmuch as the Empire existed
before the Church, it could not be derived from it. Dante elsewhere
expressed his abhorrence of the Donation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem10">
Ahi Constantin, di quanto mal fu matre,<br>
<span class="add1em">Non la tua conversion, ma quella dote</span><br>
<span class="add1em">Che da te prese il primo ricco patre!</span><br>

<span class="left30"><i>Inferno</i>, xix. 115.</span></p>

<p>Similar sentiments were expressed by many of the most popular poets from
the twelfth century to the sixteenth. Walther von der Vogelweide was
sure that if the first Christian emperor could have foreseen the evils
destined to flow from his Donation, he would have withheld it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem10">
Solte ich den pfaffen raten an den triuwen min,<br>
So spræche ir haut den armen zuo: se, daz ist din,<br>
Ir zunge sünge, unde lieze mengem man daz sin,<br>

Het er gewest, daz da von uebel kuenftik wære,<br>
So het er wol underkomen des riches swære,<br>
Wan daz si do waren kiusche, und uebermuete lære.<br>

<span class="left30">Hagen, <i>Minnesinger-Sammlung</i>, Leipsic, 1838, bd. i. p. 270.</span></p>

<p>Ariosto, in a passage rollicking with satire, makes his itinerant
paladin find the "stinking" Donation in the course of his journey upon
the moon:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem10">
Di varii fiori ad un gran monte passa,<br>
Ch' ebber già buono odore, or puzzan forte,<br>
Questo era il dono, se però dir lece,<br>
Che Constantino al buon Silvestro fece.<br>

<span class="left30"><i>Orlando Furioso</i>, xxxiv. 80.</span></p>

<p>The Donation was finally proved to be a forgery by Laurentius Valla in
1440, in his <i>De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione
declamatio</i> (afterward spread far and wide by Ulrich von Hutten), and
independently by the noble Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester, in his
<i>Repressor</i>, written about 1447.&mdash;During the preceding century the
theory of Gregory VII. and Innocent IV. had been carried to its
uttermost extreme by the Franciscan monk Alvaro Pelayo, in his <i>De
Planctu Ecclesiæ</i>, written at Avignon during the "Babylonish Captivity,"
about 1350 (printed at Venice in 1560), and by Agostino Trionfi, in his
<i>Summa de potestate ecclesiastica</i>, Augsburg, 1473, an excessively rare
book, of which there is a copy in the British Museum. These writers
maintained that the popes were suzerains of the whole earth and had
absolute power to dispose not only of all Christian kingdoms, but also
of all heathen lands and powers. It was upon this theory that Eugenius
IV. seems to have acted with reference to Portugal and Alexander VI.
with reference to Spain. Of course there was never a time when such
claims for the papacy were not denied by a large party within the
Church. The Spanish sovereigns in appealing to Alexander VI. took care
to hint that some of their advisers regarded them as already entitled to
enjoy the fruits of their discoveries, even before obtaining the papal
permission, but they did not choose to act upon that opinion (Herrera,
decad. i. lib. ii. cap. 4). The kings of Portugal were less reserved in
their submission. In <i>Valasci Ferdinandi ad Innocentium octauum de
obedientia oratio</i>, a small quarto printed at Rome about 1488, John II.
did homage to the pope for the countries just discovered by Bartholomew
Dias. His successor Emanuel did the same after the voyages of Gama and
Vespucius. In a small quarto, <i>Obedientia potentissimi Emanuelis
Lusitaniæ regis &amp;c. per clarissimum juris consultum Dieghum Pacett&#363;
oratorem ad Iuli&#363; Pont. Max.</i>, Rome, 1505, all the newly found lands
are laid at the feet of Julius II. in a passage that ends with words
worth noting: "Accipe tandem orbem ipsum terrarum, Deus enim noster es,"
i. e. "Accept in fine the earth itself, for thou art our God." Similar
homage was rendered to Leo X. in 1513, on account of Albuquerque's
conquests in Asia.&mdash;We may suspect that if the papacy had retained, at
the end of the fifteenth century, anything like the overshadowing power
which it possessed at the end of the twelfth, the kings of Portugal
would not have been quite so unstinted in their homage. As it came to be
less of a reality and more of a flourish of words, it cost less to offer
it. Among some modern Catholics I have observed a disposition to imagine
that in the famous bull of partition Alexander VI. acted not as supreme
pontiff but merely as an arbiter, in the modern sense, between the
crowns of Spain and Portugal; but such an interpretation is hardly
compatible with Alexander's own words. An arbiter, as such, does not
make awards by virtue of "the authority of Omnipotent God granted to us
in St. Peter, and of the Vicarship of Jesus Christ which we administer
upon the earth."</p>

<p>Since writing this note my attention has been called to Dr. Ignaz von
Döllinger's <i>Fables respecting the Popes of the Middle Ages</i>, London,
1871; and I find in it a chapter on the Donation of Constantine, in
which the subject is treated with a wealth of learning. Some of my brief
references are there discussed at considerable length. To the references
to Dante there is added a still more striking passage, where Constantine
is admitted into Heaven <i>in spite of</i> his Donation (<i>Paradiso</i>, xx.
55).<a href="#footnotetag546"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<p><a id="footnote547" name="footnote547"></a>
<strong>Footnote 547:</strong> The language of the bull is even more vague than my
version in the text. His Holiness describes the lands to be given to the

would be in a queer position! Probably it was meant to say that the
Spaniards, once west of the papal meridian, might go south as well as
north. For the king of Portugal had suggested that they ought to confine

<strong>Footnote 565:</strong> Bernaldez, <i>Reyes Católicos</i>, cap. cxxvii, Mr. Irving, in
citing these same incidents from Bernaldez, could not quite rid himself
of the feeling that there was something strange or peculiar in the
Admiral's method of interpreting such information: "Animated by one of
the pleasing illusions of his ardent imagination, Columbus pursued his
voyage, with a prosperous breeze, along the supposed continent of Asia."
(<i>Life of Columbus</i>, vol. i. p. 493.) This lends a false colour to the
picture, which the general reader is pretty sure to make still falser.
To suppose the southern coast of Cuba to be the southern coast of
Toscanelli's Mangi required no illusion of an "ardent imagination." It
was simply a plain common-sense conclusion reached by sober reasoning
from such data as were then accessible (i. e. the Toscanelli map,
amended by information such as was understood to be given by the
natives); it was more probable than any other theory of the situation
likely to be devised from those data; and it seems fanciful to us to-day
only because knowledge acquired since the time of Columbus has shown us
how far from correct it was. Modern historians abound in unconscious
turns of expression&mdash;as in this quotation from Irving&mdash;which project
modern knowledge back into the past, and thus destroy the historical
perspective. I shall mention several other instances from Irving, and
the reader must not suppose that this is any indication of captiousness
on my part toward a writer for whom my only feeling is that of sincerest
love and veneration.<a href="#footnotetag565"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 569:</strong> That is to say, he thought he had passed the coast of
Mangi (southern China) and reached the beginning of the coast of Champa
(Cochin China; see Yule's <i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. ii. p. 213). The name
Champa, coming to European writers through an Italian source, was
written Ciampa and Ciamba. See its position on the Behaim and Toscanelli
maps, and also on Ruysch's map, 1508, below, vol. ii. p. 114. Peter Martyr
says that Columbus was sure that he had
reached the coast of Gangetic (i. e. what we call Farther) India: "Indiæ
Gangetidis continentem eam (Cubæ) plagam esse contendit Colonus."
<i>Epist.</i> xciii. <i>ad Bernardinum</i>. Of course Columbus understood that
this region, while agreeing well enough with Toscanelli's latitude, was
far from agreeing with his longitude. But from the moment when he turned
eastward on his first voyage he seems to have made up his mind that
Toscanelli's longitudes needed serious amendment. Indeed he had always
used different measurements from Toscanelli.<a href="#footnotetag569"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 588:</strong> "All vessels were to sail exclusively from the port of

Those who embarked for Hispaniola without pay, and at their own expense,
were to have lands assigned to them, and to be provisioned for one year,
with a right to retain such lands and all houses they might erect upon
them. Of all gold which they might collect, they were to retain one
third for themselves, and pay two thirds to the crown. Of all other
articles of merchandise, the produce of the island, they were to pay
merely one tenth to the crown. Their purchases were to be made in the
presence of officers appointed by the sovereigns, and the royal duties
paid into the hands of the king's receiver. Each ship sailing on private
enterprise was to take one or two persons named by the royal officers at
Cadiz. One tenth of the tonnage of the ship was to be at the service of
the crown, free of charge. One tenth of whatever such ships should
procure in the newly-discovered countries was to be paid to the crown on
their return. These regulations included private ships trading to
Hispaniola with provisions. For every vessel thus fitted out on private
adventure, Columbus, in consideration of his privilege of an eighth of
tonnage, was to have the right to freight one on his own account."

mistake here, for on a S. W. course from the Cape Verde islands it would
require a distance of 900 geographical miles to cut the fifth parallel.
From the weather that followed, it is clear that Columbus stated his
latitude pretty correctly; he had come into the belt of calms. Therefore
his error must be in the distance run.<a href="#footnotetag590"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

continent of South America, which nobody had ever heard of, was <i>not</i>
the object of Columbus's search. The Terra Firma which was the object of
his search was the mainland of Asia, and that he never beheld, though he

<strong>Footnote 595:</strong> A modern traveller thus describes this river: "Right and
left of us lay, at some distance off, the low banks of the Apuré, at
this point quite a broad stream. But before us the waters spread out
like a wide dark flood, limited on the horizon only by a low black
streak, and here and there showing a few distant hills. This was the
Orinoco, rolling with irrepressible power and majesty sea-wards, and
often upheaving its billows like the ocean when lashed to fury by the
wind.... The Orinoco sends a current of fresh water far into the ocean,
its waters&mdash;generally green, but in the shallows milk-white&mdash;contrasting
sharply with the indigo blue of the surrounding sea." Bates, <i>Central
America, the West Indies, and South America</i>, 2d ed., London, 1882, pp.
234, 235. The island of Trinidad forms an obstacle to the escape of this
huge volume of fresh water, and hence the furious commotion at the two

August, when the Orinoco is swollen with tropical rains.<a href="#footnotetag595"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

Ovando's fleet, and as Ferdinand Columbus was with his father, the
testimony is very direct.<a href="#footnotetag608"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 609:</strong> In the next chapter I shall give some reasons for
supposing that the Admiral had learned the existence of the Yucatan
channel from the pilot Ledesma, coupled with information which made it
unlikely that a passage into the Indian ocean would be found that way.

<strong>Footnote 611:</strong> Irving (vol. ii. pp. 386, 387) seems to think it strange
that Columbus did not at once turn westward and circumnavigate Yucatan.
But if&mdash;as Irving supposed&mdash;Columbus had not seen the Yucatan channel,
and regarded the Honduras coast as continuous with that of Cuba, he
could only expect by turning westward to be carried back to Cape Alpha
and Omega, where he had already been twice before! In the next chapter,
however, I shall show that Columbus may have shaped his course in
accordance with the advice of the pilot Ledesma.<a href="#footnotetag611"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>

<strong>Footnote 614:</strong> "Nothing could evince more clearly his generous ambition
than hurrying in this brief manner along a coast where wealth was to be
gathered at every step, for the purpose of seeking a strait which,
however it might produce vast benefit to mankind, could yield little
else to himself than the glory of the discovery." Irving's <i>Columbus</i>,
vol. ii. p. 406. In this voyage, however, the express purpose from the
start was to find the strait of Malacca as a passage to the very same
regions which had been visited by Gama, and Columbus expected thus to
get wealth enough to equip an army of Crusaders. Irving's statement does
not correctly describe the Admiral's purpose, and as savouring of
misplaced eulogy, is sure to provoke a reaction on the part of captious
critics.<a href="#footnotetag614"><span class="small">[Back to Main Text]</span></a></p>
